// The Ink pack. Six thinking indicators made of ink and paper.
//
//   mi_bloom      a drop of ink meeting wet paper: a front that runs out of
//                 ink and stops, with a fringe that never stops moving.
//   mi_marbling   a combed sheet: laminar folds raked past each other, the
//                 suminagashi operator done as a shear rather than a warp.
//   mi_wick       capillary rise: ink climbing fibre against gravity to the
//                 height the pores can hold, and no further.
//   mi_strata     sediment finding its level: turbidity that laminates.
//   mi_halation   a dark mass wearing its own light, the way a dense negative
//                 wears the light that scattered back through the emulsion.
//   mi_pool       ink already at rest in a dish, meniscus alive. The stillest
//                 thing in the set.
//   mi_feather    ink that has stopped obeying the drop and started obeying the
//                 sheet: a directional bleed advancing as a comb of hairs.
//   mi_palimpsest a scraped page giving up what it used to say, in rows, and
//                 taking it back before it can be read.
//
// WHAT THE FAMILY IS. These are the ink relatives of the Pour: same blood,
// warm liquid light on a near-black ground, every value generated per pixel out
// of a field and walked through one OKLAB rail. What they do NOT share is the
// pour's body. The pour is a falling sheet; nothing here falls. The verbs in
// this pack are FLOW and SETTLE, and the physics is ink physics: fronts,
// capillarity, lamination, sediment, surface tension. If a shader in this file
// starts to read as vertical streaming metal it has drifted back into its
// parent and should be killed.
//
// WHY THE KIT IS COPIED AND NOT LINKED. Cross-file Metal linkage is not
// guaranteed, and the house has been here before: the kit is copied out of
// FieldLab.metal VERBATIM under an mi_ prefix, comments included, because the
// reasoning in those comments is the part worth carrying. Copied unchanged
// except for the name:
//
//   mi_hash, mi_grad3, mi_noised3, mi_noise3, MI_ROT, mi_fbmd3, mi_fbm3,
//   mi_srgb_to_linear, mi_linear_to_srgb, mi_linear_to_oklab,
//   mi_oklab_to_linear, mi_lch, MIPalette, mi_palette, mi_shade, mi_out,
//   mi_knee
//
// The 1D value-noise kit (fl_hash1, fl_vnoise1, fl_fbm1) is deliberately NOT
// here: nothing in this pack wants a wandering scalar on a line badly enough to
// pay for a second noise basis, and copying it would only leave dead code
// behind a prefix. Where a 1D function is wanted (the wick's front, the pool's
// shore) it is taken as a SLICE of the 3D field instead, which costs one tap
// and buys something the 1D kit cannot give: the slice can be moved through the
// third coordinate, so the function evolves IN PLACE instead of sliding
// sideways. A wet line that slides sideways is a conveyor belt. A wet line that
// changes in place is capillary action.
//
// THE ONE THING EVERY SHADER HERE DOES THAT THE POUR DOES NOT. The Murmur view
// clips to a circle, and a clip is a guillotine: whatever the field is doing at
// length(uv) = 0.5 gets cut on a hard rule. So every function in this file
// brings its light down to pure ink WELL inside that rim (mi_shore, 0.28 to
// 0.46) and composites over the ink itself, the pour's own mix(inkLin, drawn,
// containment). The clip then has nothing left to cut.
//
// BUDGET. These run at 46 pt in a chat and at 300 pt in the lab. Every function
// here spends at most three field taps a pixel, fBm at three octaves or fewer,
// every loop fixed-count. Frequencies are chosen against the SMALL size, not
// the large one: a 20 pt indicator on a 3x screen is 60 samples across, so a
// feature finer than about 1/15th of the frame has nothing left to stand on and
// turns into shimmer. Where that limit could not be respected honestly (the
// marbling veins) the shader band-limits itself with fwidth and dissolves the
// detail into the mass it belongs to, which is the Contour field's trick and
// the only correct answer to a line finer than a pixel.
//
// TEMPO, and this pack was retuned once on it. The first cut set its rates
// against the Pour, which is an ambient card a person glances at, and against
// that reference everything here was correct and everything here was too slow.
// These are THINKING indicators: they stand in for attention, not for weather,
// and attention has a pulse. So the internal rates were lifted between about
// 1.4x and 1.9x, per style, and the rule for spending that was CARRIER BEFORE
// DETAIL. Each species has one motion that carries its gesture (the bloom's
// fringe, the marbling rakes, the wick's wet line, the strata rock, the
// halation morph) and one that only textures it (the mottle, the sheet, the
// grain, the convection, the tremor). The carriers took the larger share and
// the details the smaller, which is what makes the set read faster without
// reading busier: more speed on the same number of things, rather than more
// things. Pool took the smallest lift of the six on purpose, because being the
// stillest of the set is not a tuning of that species, it is the species.
//
// `speed` still means what it always meant. 1.0 is the designed tempo; what
// changed is what the design IS.

// MARK: The flourish clock
//
// Every species in this pack performs ONE gesture: something the material does
// occasionally and then lets go of. This is the clock they all share, and the
// three properties it has are the three the gestures needed.
//
// APERIODIC, AND STILL DETERMINISTIC. Time is cut into slots of P = 6.5 s and
// each slot holds exactly one occurrence, starting at a hashed offset inside a
// window of B = 2.5 s. The interval between two occurrences is therefore
// P + (h_next - h_prev) * B, which lands anywhere in [P - B, P + B] = 4 to 9
// seconds and never twice the same. Nothing accumulates and nothing is
// remembered: sample any t at all, from a screenshot rig or a scrubbed slider,
// and the same occurrence is in the same place. A metronome would have been one
// line shorter and the eye finds a metronome in about three repetitions.
//
// The arithmetic guarantees the slots never collide: the latest an occurrence
// can start is B, and the longest any of them lasts is 2.5 s, so the last one
// ends by 5.0 s inside a 6.5 s slot. That is why only the current slot is ever
// tested, and why `dur` must stay at or under 2.5.
//
// FLAT AT BOTH ENDS. The envelope is a smoothstep up and a smoothstep down, so
// its derivative is zero where it leaves rest and zero where it returns. The
// material never snaps into a gesture or out of one. `rise` sits well under
// half, because a flourish that takes as long to arrive as to relax reads as a
// throb; quick out and slow back is what a gesture is.
//
// AND ZERO IS EXACTLY ZERO. Every gesture in this file is multiplied by the
// envelope, so between occurrences each species is the material that was
// approved, to the bit. The play is added on top of the resting state, never
// mixed into it.
//
// The clock rides each species' own `t`, which already carries the speed dial,
// so the 4-to-9 seconds is a statement about the designed tempo of 1.0.

// MARK: The states
//
// Two of the five states are expressed in the shader; the other three are
// carried entirely by their parameter sets, which is the right division of
// labour because a dial set can say "dim and near-still" perfectly well and
// cannot say "an arrival travelled through this material".
//
// SUCCESS, in ink, is a BLOOM OF SATURATION. The one thing this family must
// not do is lay white over the top: paper does not get whiter when the answer
// lands, ink gets DEEPER. So the surge walks the existing field further up the
// rail, from deep amber toward the tone, where there is more chroma and more
// light and it is still the same hue. That is what "the ink drinks" means
// literally: the mark takes up more pigment and holds it.
//
// It travels, and travelling is what makes it an arrival rather than a fade.
// Each species hands mi_drink its own progress coordinate q, so the surge
// sweeps root to tip up the wick, centre to rim across the pool, fold after
// fold along the marbling's lay. The front covers q in 0.7 s and the crest is
// wide enough (0.27 of q) that a small indicator sees a wash rather than a
// scanline. What it leaves behind does not go away: `held` settles at 0.42 and
// stays while the state holds, which is the "settling rich" half of the brief.
//
// RESPONDING is decisive drive, and it is the harder of the two to do honestly
// in a shader with no memory. The obvious implementation, speeding the clock
// up, accumulates: leave the state after twenty seconds and the material jumps
// back by twenty seconds' worth of extra travel. So the drive is built out of
// three things that are all bounded:
//
//   lean    a directional advance that SATURATES, 1 - e^(-tau/0.5), so it
//           arrives over about a second and a half and then holds. Worst case
//           on leaving the state is one bounded nudge, not an unbounded jump.
//   drive   a 0-to-1 ramp for anything that changes AMPLITUDE or COHERENCE:
//           wider wander, tighter forms, sharper alignment. None of it
//           accumulates, so none of it can jump.
//   neither one touches brightness. "Answering now" is posture and motion.
//
// Both ramps are smoothstep or exponential from zero, so entering a state
// never snaps. Leaving one is the Swift layer's problem and it crossfades the
// whole parameter set over 0.6 s to cover it.

// BLOOM. A drop of ink meeting wet paper.
//
// THE ARC, and it is the whole species. A blot does not spread forever and it
// does not spread at a constant rate: it spreads until the ink it was given is
// spent. The conserved quantity is AREA, not radius, so the law is stated on
// area and the radius is read off it:
//
//   Ȧ = (A∞ - A) / T     the rate falls with what is left to give
//   A(τ) = A∞ (1 - e^(-τ/T))
//   R(τ) = R∞ sqrt(1 - e^(-τ/T))
//
// which is the closed form, not an integration: sample it at any τ at all and
// it lands exactly where the animation would have been. The sqrt is the part
// you can see. It puts almost all of the travel in the first second, the way
// ink actually leaves a nib, and then the front creeps for a long time before
// it arrives. T is 1.25 s, and it is still a statement in real seconds rather
// than a normalised unit: the blot is three quarters of the way out in under a
// second and at the lab's four-second still frame it is at 98% of final, which
// reads as arrived without reading as stopped.
//
// AND WHY IT IS STILL ALIVE AT REST. Nothing about a settled blot is static.
// Two things keep running after the front has stopped, both of them free:
// the fringe noise moves through its third coordinate, so the fingers grow and
// retract in place; and the interior texture is read at a radius pulled back by
// the distance the front has already travelled, which means the mottling keeps
// creeping outward forever at a vanishing rate. Arrived, still moving. That is
// what ink on paper does and it is the opposite of a frozen frame.
//
// THE FRINGE has no seam because it is not an angular function. It is a 3D
// field read on a RING: sample the unit circle inside the noise and the result
// is periodic in theta by construction, so there is no join at the back of the
// blot to hide.
//
// THE GRAIN. Paper is anisotropic; ink runs further along the fibre than
// across it, and the drop never lands dead centre. Both of those are the same
// knob, because they are the same fact about the sheet.

// travelling. Nothing here falls, nothing pulses, and there is no loop point:
// the three phase rates (0.57, 0.41, 0.31 rad/s) are incommensurate, so the
// pattern never repeats and the eye never finds the cycle. The slowest of them
// comes round in about twenty seconds and the fastest in eleven, which is a
// comb being drawn at a working pace rather than a tide going out.
//
// THE LAMINAE, and the honest problem with them. Marbled ink reads as thin
// concentrated veins, and a thin vein is exactly the thing a 20 pt indicator
// cannot draw: below a pixel a line is not a line, it is aliasing. So the bands
// band-limit themselves. The cosine is multiplied by exp(-(pi w)^2 / 2), which

// MARK: - 3. Wick

// WICK. Ink climbing fibre. Gravity in reverse, and the paper visible in it.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO ARC HERE even though capillary rise obviously has one. The
// climb of a wetting front goes as sqrt(t), Washburn, and it would make a
// lovely arrival; but a wick is a STATE, not an event, and a style that arrives
// once and then holds is already in this pack twice. So this one is written at
// the equilibrium instead, which is the other half of the same physics and the
// half nobody draws: Jurin's law, where every pore climbs to the height its own
// radius can hold and stops. Fine fibre high, coarse fibre low, and the wet
// line is therefore RAGGED by construction rather than by decoration.
//
// The front is a slice of the 3D field taken along x with time in z, so the
// height at a given place changes IN PLACE. That matters more than it sounds.
// The obvious implementation moves the noise sideways, and a wet line that
// travels sideways is a conveyor belt; a wet line that rises and stalls where
// it stands is stick-slip in a porous medium, which is the thing capillary
// fronts actually do.
//
// WHAT MOVES, since the front does not. The grain inside the wet region is read
// at a y pulled DOWNWARD by time, so the fibre texture creeps up through the
// standing front at six hundredths of a frame a second. The front has
// arrived; the ink has not stopped. That is the whole feeling of a wick and it
// is one term.
//
// AND THE TIDE LINE. Where the front stalls, solvent keeps leaving and pigment
// does not, so the edge of a chromatogram is always the darkest part of it.
// Same gaussian as the bloom's, same reason, and it is what makes the ragged
// line legible at 20 pt: the gesture is an edge, not a mass.

// HALATION. A dark mass wearing its own light.
//
// The name is photographic and so is the effect: on a dense negative, light
// that got through the emulsion scatters off the backing and comes back out
// AROUND the dense area, so the darkest thing in the frame is the thing wearing
// the glow. Nothing else in this pack is lit that way. Every other style here
// is bright where the material is; this one is dark where the material is and
// bright at its shoulder.
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING TRICK, and it is the only reason this style is affordable.
// A halo of even width around an irregular silhouette normally costs a blur:
// eight or twelve taps of the mass field to find how far away the boundary is.
// It costs one tap here, because the fBm carries its own analytic gradient, and
// a first-order signed distance to the level set is
//
//   d = (f - threshold) / |grad f|
//
// in the SAME units as the frame once the gradient is carried back through the
// domain scale by the chain rule. That division is the whole point. Without it
// the halo is thick wherever the field is flat and a hairline wherever it is
// steep, which does not read as light at all: it reads as a printing fault. One
// mi_fbmd3 at three octaves buys the mass, its silhouette, the halo width, the
// rim and the direction the light falls from, and nothing else in this file is
// cheaper.
//
// THE OFFSET is which way the scatter goes. The halo is weighted by how much
// the boundary's outward normal faces the light, so the mass is not ringed
// evenly: one shoulder carries the glow and the other keeps its dark. A
// symmetric halo around a blob is a sticker; an asymmetric one is a body in a
// room with a light in it.

// MARK: - 6. Pool

// POOL. Ink already at rest in a shallow dish. The stillest style in the set.
//
// Every other shader here is about ink going somewhere. This one has arrived,
// and the whole design question was what is left to look at when nothing is
// happening. The answer a real dish of ink gives: the surface is a mirror, and
// a mirror does not need to move to be alive. A tremor a fraction of a degree
// across is invisible as displacement and enormous as REFLECTION, because the
// specular exponent turns a tenth of a degree of slope into a visible swing of
// light. So the tremor knob defaults to 0.2 and the picture still changes all
// afternoon. That asymmetry between how much the surface moves and how much the
// light moves is the entire species.
//
// THE SLOPE IS ANALYTIC. The surface is one mi_fbmd3 and the normal comes off
// its gradient in the same evaluation, which is what the derivative kit is for.
// Finite differences would have cost four more taps to compute a quantity the
// field already knows, and they would have carried the lattice's stairs into
// the highlight where a mirror shows them worst.
//
// THE MENISCUS. Ink climbs the wall of the dish over its capillary length, and
// that climb is a steep curved surface right at the shore, so it catches a line
// of light the flat middle never gets. It is added to the SLOPE and not to the
// brightness, which means the rim highlight obeys the same light as everything
// else: brighter where the wall faces the source, dark where it turns away.
// Painting it as a ring of light instead would have drawn a circle, and a
// circle is the one shape this pack is not allowed to draw.
//
// THE SHORE IS A PUDDLE, not a machined disc. The radius wanders about a
// seventh with a slow angular noise, the dish leans so the ink pools to one
// side, and there is a dried tide of pigment just outside the wet edge where an
// earlier fill retreated. Those three together are what keep this from reading
// as a lit dot, which it must never do.

// MARK: - 7. Feather

// FEATHER. Ink running along the grain, hair by hair.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT ANOTHER BLOOM, which is the first thing to answer because the
// two species share a chemistry. A blot on sized paper spreads the same distance
// in every direction and its story is a circle with a tide line. This is what
// happens on paper that is sized badly or not at all: the ink stops obeying the
// drop and starts obeying the SHEET, running along the fibre far and across it
// barely, so what advances is not a front but a comb of hairs, each one a
// channel, with the mass filling in behind them. Bloom is isotropic and its
// silhouette is round. This is anisotropic and its silhouette is a plume with a
// toothed leading edge. Put the two side by side at 76 pt and nothing about them
// rhymes, which was the requirement.
//
// THE ARC IS ALSO A DIFFERENT LAW, and the difference is not decoration. Bloom
// conserves AREA, so its radius carries a square root and nearly all of its
// travel happens in the first moment. Here the plume is channelled: it advances
// at roughly constant width, so the area it has wetted is proportional to the
// LENGTH, and spending a fixed reservoir of ink over that gives
//
//   L̇ = (L∞ - L) / T      →      L(τ) = L∞ + (L0 - L∞) e^(-τ/T)
//
// a plain exponential approach with no root in it. Closed form, so any τ lands
// where the animation would have been. In the eye the two arcs read as two
// different events: the blot lunges and then creeps for a long time, the feather
// sets off at a walk and eases into its stop. T is 1.45 s, a little longer than
// the blot's 1.25, because a bleed has further to go.
//
// REST IS NOT STILL. When L has arrived the hairs keep working: the fringe noise
// runs on through its third coordinate at 0.22, which is the pack's post-tempo
// rate, so the teeth of the comb lengthen and retract against each other without
// the plume as a whole going anywhere. That is capillary shimmer, and it is what
// a saturated feather actually does under a loupe.
//
//   c0 bleed      how far the plume gets before the ink is spent
//   c1 fiber      the pitch of the grain: how many hairs, how deep the comb, how
//                 visible the striation inside the wetted mass
//   c2 direction  the heading, in turns. This is the knob that keeps the species
//                 off bloom's ground, so it is a real axis and not a nudge

// MARK: - 8. Palimpsest

// PALIMPSEST. Older writing coming up through the sheet.
//
// A palimpsest is a page that was scraped and written over, and the ghost of
// what it used to say keeps rising back through the new surface. That is the
// species: marks that are almost readable, in rows, that surface somewhere,
// hold for a moment and are taken back into the paper before they ever resolve.
//
// THE ONE HARD RULE. There are no letterforms here and there is no font. What
// makes a mark read as WRITING is not its shapes, it is two facts about how it
// is arranged: strokes are thin curved things of varying width, and they sit in
// ROWS with blank between them. Give the eye those two facts and it supplies the
// language by itself, which is the whole trick and also the only honest way to
// do it: a shader that actually drew glyphs would be drawing someone's alphabet,
// and it would resolve, and resolving is the one thing this species must never
// do.
//
// So the strokes are RIDGED noise: 1 - |fBm|, whose level sets are continuous
// curves that thin and thicken along their length exactly the way a pen does.
// The rows are a band-limited cosine on a wandering baseline, because no hand
// writes on a rule. And the sharpening exponent is what ages them: raised, it
// thins the strokes until they break into fragments where the ridge dips, which
// is what happens to ink that has been scraped off a page.

// WHAT MOVES, and this is the species' real idea. Nothing does. Every other
// shader in this pack advects something: the blot creeps, the marble slides, the
// wick transports, the bed rocks, the mass drifts, the pool's sheen wanders. The
// writing here is IN the paper and the paper is not going anywhere. What moves
// is a slow surfacing field that decides, per place, how much of the sheet's
// memory is currently visible. The marks do not travel; your access to them
// does. That is what memory is like and it is the reason this reads as thought
// rather than as weather.
//
// AND WHY IT IS NOT THE SIGNAL FAMILY'S VEIL, which occupies the neighbouring
// register of almost-legibility. Veil is a stack of translucent scrims with a
// real transmittance chain: what is behind is dimmed by exactly what is in front
// of it, per pixel, and legibility is a matter of gaps opening in the layers.
// Nothing here is in front of anything. Both texts are in the same sheet at the
// same depth, and the one surfacing field gates them in OPPOSITION: where the
// field is high the newer hand comes up, where it is low the older one does, and
// in the wide middle both are half present. Two texts trading places in one
// surface, not two sheets seen through each other.
//
//   c0 layers     how far apart the two hands sit: angle, size of writing, and
//                 how sharply they trade
//   c1 legibility how close the strokes come to resolving. It is capped below 1
//                 on purpose and there is no setting that lets you read it
//   c2 surfacing  how far up the writing is allowed to come
//   c3 age        how eroded the older hand is: thinner, more broken, more gap
