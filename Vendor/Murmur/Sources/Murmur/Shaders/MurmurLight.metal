// The Light pack. Six thinking indicators made of light that has been THROUGH
// something before it reaches the eye: water, air, fog, dust, heat. The Liquid
// pack has the pour's weight and the Ink pack has paper's capillary time; this
// family's subject is a medium, and the medium is what moves.
//
//   mg_caustic  the fold of a caustic on a pool floor: a soft web, drawn as the
//               zero set of the ray map's Jacobian, never as cells.
//   mg_aurora   a curtain of light folded in slow air. Hard lower border, soft
//               top, brightness where the folds overlap. Nothing falls.
//   mg_ember    the air above a warm floor: light pooled low, the coals seen
//               through their own rising shimmer.
//   mg_lantern  one lamp of CONSTANT brightness behind drifting fog. What moves
//               is the fog, and the shadows it throws across its own light.
//   mg_mirage   the desert road: one small distant light, its image sliced and
//               doubled by layered air and folded below the inversion into an
//               inverted second copy. The bands themselves are never drawn.
//   mg_oculus   an aperture admitting light, opening as the thought completes.
//               Open is the rest state, and rest is not a freeze.
//   mg_dapple   canopy light: two layers of leaves sliding past each other, and
//               the floor lit wherever their gaps happen to line up.
//   mg_eclipse  a soft dark mass wandering across a light it never leaves and
//               never clears. The corona at its limb is the whole picture.
//
// THE FAMILY LAW, and every one of these obeys it. Time enters where a
// COORDINATE IS READ, never as a brightness multiplier. That is not a style
// preference here, it is the whole difference between a lantern and a novelty
// lamp: mg_lantern's source is exactly as bright at t = 300 as it was at t = 0,
// and the picture is alive anyway because the medium in front of it is not
// where it was. A light that throbs is the failure mode this family is most
// exposed to, so none of the six modulates emission with time at all. Check any
// of them by deleting `time` from the field and looking at what stops: it must
// be the medium, never the light.
//
// THE SCALE CONSTRAINT, which is new to this pack and governs every frequency
// below. These are indicators, drawn at 46 pt in a chat row and at 300 pt on a
// design surface, and the uv frame here is normalised so ONE UV UNIT IS THE
// SHORT SIDE. At 46 pt that means a noise cell of 0.06 uv is under three
// points across. Anything finer sparkles instead of drifting, which is the
// opposite of calm and is also what aliases first. So the rule the numbers here
// are picked against: the FINEST octave's cell stays at or above ~0.06 uv.
// With the kit's 2.03 lacunarity that caps a three octave field near f = 4 and
// a two octave field near f = 8, and where a frequency below sits at the top of
// its range the comment says which octave count is holding it there.
//
// THE TEMPO, and what `speed` = 1.0 means. These were first tuned to the calm of
// an ambient card, and on device the whole set read one notch too still: an
// indicator is ATTENTION, not atmosphere, and a thinking indicator that barely
// moves says the thinking has stopped. Every internal rate constant below was
// therefore lifted between 1.5x and 2x. The `speed` uniform still means "the
// designed tempo"; what changed is what the designed tempo IS.
//
// The lift is not uniform inside a style, and the rule it follows is worth
// keeping. Where a style has a CARRIER motion (a whole pattern translating) and
// a DETAIL motion (the same pattern reorganising in place), the carrier takes
// the full 2x and the detail takes about 1.5x. Translation reads as speed;
// churn reads as busyness. Lift them together and the field gets faster AND
// noisier, which is how calm turns into stormy. Lift the carrier harder and it
// reads faster at the same density, which is what was actually wanted.
//
// Two rates deliberately did not take the full lift. mg_lantern's light does not
// move at all, by contract, so its whole increase went into the fog drifting in
// front of it. mg_oculus's opening arc stays at 2.6 REAL seconds, because it
// describes an event rather than a texture and it has to keep meaning what it
// says; only the medium under it sped up.
//
// THE PLAY, which is the newest layer and the one most easily got wrong. Each
// of the eight performs ONE gesture: a flourish it does and then lets go of,
// recurring aperiodically every four to nine seconds off mg_beat's hash. The
// gestures, one line each:
//
//   caustic  a swell passes and the web gathers to a focus under it, then
//            disperses. The gesture is a local rise in the FOCUSING STRENGTH,
//            so more of the field crosses the fold threshold there.
//   aurora   a wave runs along the curtain and it settles, reaching each lamina
//            slightly later than the one in front.
//   ember    a gust leans the column over and it recovers, the top leaning
//            further than the base the way a rising column actually does.
//   lantern  the fog parts AROUND the light: the outer veil lifts, the halo
//            contracts, the source stands out, and then it closes again.
//   mirage   a stronger stratum rolls down the road, tearing the light into
//            more slices as it passes.
//   oculus   an eddy crosses the beam and the air in the light turns with it.
//   dapple   a gust swings the near canopy and a patch chases across the floor.
//   eclipse  the mass scoots ahead along its own path and settles back, which
//            swings the bright crescent round the limb and back.
//
// THREE RULES THEY ALL KEEP. The gesture lives in COORDINATES or in the medium,
// never in a brightness multiplier: where the light level changes it is because
// something moved in front of it or because the geometry that concentrates light
// changed, which is the family law applied to flourishes. It enters and leaves
// on mg_beat's envelope, whose ends are flat, so nothing snaps. And it is an
// exact algebraic identity at rest, so between gestures each style is bit for
// bit the material that was approved rather than a near copy of it.
//
// Each style draws on its own hash lane, so eight of these sitting in a gallery
// never flourish together. That would read as a system doing something rather
// than as eight materials each doing their own thing, and it is the first thing
// a shared lane would have cost.
//
// THE ORB LAW, which supersedes the figure wave's open-ended figures and is the
// composition every one of these now has. Each species is ONE compact, centred,
// roughly spherical presence that could plausibly be the assistant. The species
// is what that presence is MADE OF, never a scene it sits in: the pool floor,
// the hearth, the horizon and the road are all gone, and what survived from
// each of them is its physics, which transferred without argument. A caustic
// wraps a ball as readily as it lands on a floor; an aurora is a latitude band
// whether the planet is in the frame or not; a mirage bends whatever image is
// put in front of it, and it turns out the assistant's own body is a better
// subject than a distant car was.
//
// mg_orb gives all eight the same body: a normal, a path length, and a surface
// metric. The material is then read in the sphere's arc length so it compresses
// at the limb, and dimmed by the path so the presence reads round. Both of those
// are the sphere doing the work rather than shading laid over a flat field.
//
// THE CONTAINMENT. The view clips to a circle. A clip that lands on lit pixels
// draws a hard rim, and a hard rim on an organic form is the one edge this
// house never ships, so every style brings its light down to pure ink well
// inside length(uv) = 0.5 through mg_hold before the clip is ever consulted.
// The clip should have nothing left to cut.
//
// COPIED HELPERS. Cross-file Metal linkage is not guaranteed, so the kit is
// copied out of FieldLab.metal and FieldPackPour.metal VERBATIM under an mg_
// prefix, the way the house has done it before. Copied, unchanged except for
// the name:
//
//   mg_hash, mg_grad3, mg_noised3, mg_noise3, MG_ROT, mg_fbmd3, mg_fbm3,
//   mg_srgb_to_linear, mg_linear_to_srgb, mg_linear_to_oklab,
//   mg_oklab_to_linear, mg_lch, MGPalette, mg_palette, mg_shade, mg_out,
//   mg_knee, mg_hash1, mg_vnoise1, mg_fbm1
//
// Their comments come with them: the reasoning is the part worth carrying.
// mg_hold is the one helper written rather than copied, and it says why.
// Nothing here is behind the prefix that the six styles do not call.
//
// A NOTE ON THE NUMBERS, in the pour's spirit of saying which is which. The
// pour's constants were fitted against a photograph of the shipped card. These
// were not: they are reasoned from the octave weights, the uv scale above, and
// what each medium actually does, and the reviewing session's screenshots are
// the first time any of them meets an eye. Where a constant is the one to move
// if the picture disagrees, the comment names it.

// #4F1D0B to #82421A, the murky rust the review rejected. There was no third
// tier at all. The rail always had the cream in it; nothing was reaching it.

// mg_tier is the fix, and it takes a figure's own intensity (0 where the figure
// is not, 1 at its hottest structure) and lands it on the three tiers:

//
// The three segments are smoothstepped so their ends are flat and the joins are

// shows up as a contour line in a smooth field. The important property is that

// THE RULE THEY ALL FOLLOW, and it is not a taste rule but a correctness one:
// a live signal may move an AMPLITUDE, a THRESHOLD or a piece of GEOMETRY, and
// it may never move a RATE. The reason is the one mg_driveDist already had to
// solve, and it is worse here. Writing `position = velocity * t * (1 + level)`
// gives an actual velocity of `v(1 + level) + v t level'`, and t is absolute
// time in the thousands while level is a microphone: level' is large and
// arbitrary many times a second, so the field would not quicken, it would
// convulse. The drive could be integrated in closed form because its shape was
// known in advance; a live signal has no closed form, and integrating it would
// need state between frames, which this pack does not have and will not take.
//
// So nothing below multiplies t. What the signals do instead is open a gap
// wider, focus a lens harder, part a fog further, deepen a fold: quantities
// that are read fresh each frame and carry no history, so an arbitrary jump in
// the signal produces an arbitrary jump in a shape and never a discontinuity in
// a position. The Swift layer's generic response covers the tempo side.

/// THE APERIODIC BEAT. A metronome is the failure mode here: anything that
/// recurs on a fixed period stops being a flourish within about three
/// repetitions and becomes a tic, and the eye locks onto it and will not let go.

/// time, which is to say it is a closed-form function of t with no state.
///
/// Time is cut into slots of L seconds and gesture k begins somewhere inside
/// slot k, at an offset the hash picks out of a window of J:

///     onset(k) = k L + hash(k) J
///     gap      = onset(k+1) - onset(k) = L + (hash(k+1) - hash(k)) J

/// J is derived from L rather than passed, as whichever of L - 4.05 and 8.95 - L
/// is smaller, which is the widest jitter that keeps EVERY gap inside the four
/// to nine seconds the brief asks for whatever period a style chooses.
///
/// EACH STYLE PASSES A DIFFERENT L, and that is not decoration. An earlier cut
/// gave all eight the same 6.5 s slot grid, and while their jitter spread them
/// out inside a window, their mean rate was identical, so they stayed
/// phase-locked to one rhythm forever and never drifted through each other. Put
/// eight of those in a gallery and the eye finds the shared pulse behind them
/// within a minute. Periods between 5.6 and 7.4 are mutually incommensurate
/// enough that the set never comes back into register.
///
/// Only two slots are ever examined, because a gesture cannot outlive the slot
/// after its own: D is clamped under L - J, which is also what guarantees that
/// two gestures of the same style never overlap.
///
/// THE ENVELOPE is a product of two smoothsteps rather than a bump function,
/// because both of a smoothstep's ends are flat and that is the whole
/// requirement: nothing may snap on, and nothing may snap off. It peaks at
/// exactly 1 at u = 0.34, so the flourish arrives in about a third of its life
/// and spends the other two thirds letting go, which is the difference between a
/// gesture and a twitch.
///

/// so at rest each one is an exact algebraic identity and the resting material
/// is the material that was approved, not a near copy of it.

//
// The web is the whole species, and the honest question is what a caustic web
// actually IS. It is not a cell pattern, which is why every Voronoi version of
// this reads as a lie: it is the FOLD of the map that carries rays from the
// water surface to the floor. Take a surface height h, refract, and every point
// of the surface sends its ray to
//
//     floor(p) = p - k grad h(p)
//
// The floor's brightness at a point is the number of rays that land in a unit
// area there, which is one over the determinant of that map's Jacobian:
//
//     J = I - k H,      H = the Hessian of h
//     det J = (1 - k Hxx)(1 - k Hyy) - k^2 Hxy^2
//
// Where det J crosses zero, an area of surface collapses onto a curve of floor
// and the light there is unbounded. That curve family, smooth and wandering and
// closing on itself, IS the web. It is drawn here as w / (w + |det J|), which is
// the same shape as 1/|det| with a width instead of an infinity, so the threads
// are soft at every scale and there is no exposure at which they blow out.
//
// The Hessian costs two extra taps and no finite differencing of the VALUE,
// because the kit's mg_fbmd3 already returns the analytic gradient: differencing
// the gradient once gives the second derivative for the price of two more field
// evaluations instead of the eight a value-space Hessian would need. That is the
// derivative in the kit finally earning its keep. Six taps total.
//
// TWO OCTAVES, and this one is physics rather than budget. A water surface is
// smooth: capillary detail exists but it does not focus, and adding octaves here
// puts the Hessian's energy in the top octave, which fills the frame with tiny
// closed loops and lands exactly on the cellular reading this species must never
// have. Two octaves keeps the folds broad and the web legible at 20 pt.
//
// THE NUMBER TO MOVE. `k` below is the focusing strength, and it is reasoned
// rather than photographed: the fBm's second-derivative gain over its base
// octave is 0.5 + 0.25 * 2.03^2 = 1.53, the base octave's own curvature runs
// around 4, so H sits near 6 typical and k near 0.16 puts k H at about 1, which
// is where folds start forming. If the web comes out sparse, raise the 0.20; if
// it comes out busy, lower it. Nothing else in this style needs to move.
//
//   c0 web     how much surface there is across the frame: fewer, broader folds
//              to more of them.
//   c1 depth   how far the floor is below the surface. Deeper water focuses
//              harder, so this is literally k.
//   c2 swim    NOT a second speed dial. It sets how much of the motion is the
//              water body TRAVELLING across the floor versus reorganising in
//              place. At 0 the web churns without going anywhere; at 1 it
//              drifts, and the drift is what makes a small indicator read as

// MARK: - 2. Aurora

// AURORA. A curtain of light folded in slow air.
//
// The grammar is horizontal and nothing falls, which is the whole distance
// between this and the Liquid pack. What an aurora is, physically, is a SHEET
// seen edge on: brightness is path length through the sheet, so where the sheet
// folds back across itself the light doubles, and that doubling is the only
// place a curtain ever gets bright. There is no emission dial in this style at
// all beyond the house one, because the brightening is geometry.
//
// THE ARCHED RIBBON, which is the figure wave's change here and the largest
// rebuild of the composition in the pack.
//
// The old profile was a sharp lower border with an exponential fade upward, on
// the honest grounds that a real curtain's bottom edge is its crispest feature
// and its top dissolves over kilometres. That is true of the sky and it was
// wrong for a 20 pt badge: a shape with one edge and an open top is not a
// silhouette, it is a gradient, and what the cell actually read as was a glow
// dome. There was nothing to name.
//
// So the curtain is now a RIBBON: a band with a top edge as well as a bottom
// one, arched across the frame on a parabola that lifts it in the middle and
// settles it at both sides. That is a shape a person can name at a glance, and
// the arch is what makes it a ribbon rather than a bar.
//
// The physics did not have to be given up to get it. The bottom edge is still
// the crisper of the two, and the top edge is a fast falloff rather than a hard
// cut, so it is legible without ever being a drawn line. What the sky loses is
// its infinite diffuse top, which the badge could not show anyway.
//
// THREE LAMINAE, feet 0.03 uv apart, each wandering on its own pair of 1D fBm
// lanes at its own rate. They are not three curtains: they are one sheet seen
// where it folds, which is why their feet sit so close together and why their
// sum is allowed to exceed one. Where two cross, the light doubles, and the
// bright vertical concentrations that appear and slide are the folds. On a line
// this costs two hashes an octave rather than the thirty two a 3D lattice would,
// which is what makes three of them affordable at 300 pt.
//
// The rays are one octave of value noise, not fBm, and that is deliberate. Two
// octaves put ray structure under three points at 46 pt and it sparkled. One
// quintic octave is a soft undulation in the curtain's brightness, which is what
// rays look like when you are not standing under them. They lean with height,
// because a curtain's rays follow the field lines and the field lines are not
// vertical in the picture plane.
//
//   c0 fold    how far the sheet wanders vertically. Low is a calm band, high
//              is a curtain with real folds in it.
//   c1 height  the exponential scale of the top's fade. How much of the frame
//              the curtain occupies above its foot.
//   c2 wander  how fast the folds travel. The three laminae drift at different
//              rates by construction, so this never reads as one sliding image.
//   c3 thin    the sheet's cross section. High is a defined lower border and a
//              compact curtain; low is a soft aurora seen through cloud.

//                 plume are both sampled at x + dx where dx is a slow field
//                 growing with height, because there is no bending in the first
//                 millimetre above a floor and plenty of it higher up. The

//   the rise      the plume's domain scrolls DOWN in height as t grows, which
//                 carries its structure up. This is the Liquid pack's fall

//                 reads as a scrolling texture in a box rather than as gas
//                 leaving a fire.
//
// The bed is a FIELD and not a ramp: patches of noise confined near the floor
// line by an exponential, so some coals are hot and some are not, the way a bed
// of embers actually looks. A vertical gradient dimmed at the top would have
// been half the code and would have failed the first rule in the spec.

///
/// So the density is a thin even haze with sparse THICK WISPS drifting through
/// it, and the smoothstep is what makes them sparse: below 0.40 of the noise
/// range there is only haze, and the wisp term climbs from there. The mean stays
/// low, so path length contributes little, while crossing a wisp costs several
/// times a clear path. Now the optical depth answers to WHAT the light passed

/// and they sweep as it drifts.
///
/// The domain is compressed 2.2x across, because fog in still air lies in

// This is the style the family law was written for, so it is worth being exact.
// The lamp's power is a CONSTANT. It appears in the code once, it is never
// multiplied by anything derived from `time`, and if the fog were removed the
// picture would be a still image. Every bit of life on screen comes from the
// medium sliding in front of the light. A lantern that throbs is a novelty; a
// lantern whose fog is moving is a lantern.
//
// The model is single scattering, which is the honest one and also the cheap
// one. The eye sees the fog AT the pixel, lit by the lamp, dimmed by whatever
// fog stands between:
//
//     L(p) = rho(p) * Lamp(|p - lamp|) * exp(-ext * integral of rho from lamp to p)
//
// The integral is four samples along the line from the pixel toward the lamp,
// which with the pixel's own density and the lamp's own is six field taps and
// the whole budget of this style. What that integral buys is the thing that
// makes the picture: a thick wisp standing between the lamp and one side of the
// frame throws a soft SHADOW across it, and as the fog drifts those shadows
// sweep. Nothing in the frame is drawn as a ray and there is not a single hard
// edge anywhere, and yet the light visibly comes from a place. It only works
// because the fog is lumpy, which is the point mg_fog above is making.
//
// The lamp is never drawn. There is no disc, no core, no falloff sprite: the
// brightest pixel on screen is bright because the fog is dense THERE, so the
// centre of the glow wears the fog's own shape and can never resolve into an
// orb. Watch the middle of it drift off round as a wisp crosses. That is the
// species.
//
//   c0 fog     density and extinction together, and it moves both the haze
//              floor and the wisps. Low is a clear night with a lamp a long way
//              off and only a suggestion of structure; high is weather, where
//              the light barely gets out of its own halo and the shadows across
//              it are the loudest thing in the frame.
//   c1 reach   how far the light carries: the softening radius of the inverse
//              square. This is also the dial that decides whether the indicator
//              reads as one presence or as a lit field.
//   c2 drift   how fast the fog crosses and turns over.
//   c3 offset  how far the lamp sits off centre. At 0 it is dead centre, which
//              is the least interesting composition and is not the default.

// MARK: - 6. Oculus

// OCULUS. A soft aperture admitting light, opening as the thought completes.
//
// The arc style of this pack, and the one with the most obvious way to fail: an
// aperture is a round hole, the indicator is a round hole, and a lazy version of
// this is a glowing ball inside a circle, which is the fibonacci dot sphere the
// whole package exists to not be. Four things keep it an opening:
//
//   the edge is TORN. Its radius is a noise field evaluated on the unit circle,
//   which is periodic in the angle by construction and so has no seam at the
//   wrap. About seven bays around the rim at the base octave, wandering. It is
//   never a circle at any instant.
//   the light LEANS. What comes through an oculus comes from a direction, so the
//   interior brightens toward the upper left and falls away opposite. A radially
//   symmetric interior is what makes a hole look like a ball.
//   the interior has STRUCTURE. Two octaves of slow field, so the admitted light
//   is a piece of sky and not a fill.
//   the beam is made of AIR. The glow outside the opening is the interior light
//   carried into the medium and multiplied by a fine drifting field, so its
//   falloff is textured rather than smooth. That texture is `dust`, and it is a
//   density, never motes: the frequency is held low enough that at 46 pt the
//   finest structure is over three points across and reads as air.
//
// THE ARRIVAL. tau is measured from `epoch` and the aperture opens on
// mg_open_law over 2.6 s, which is about the length of a thought that has
// finished. The still-opening fraction does one extra job while it lasts: the
// lip is more agitated during the opening and settles as it arrives, so a
// photograph at half a second and a photograph at eight are visibly different
// pictures rather than the same picture at two offsets.
//
// The open time is deliberately NOT divided by `speed`. Like the pour's
// exhaleTime it is a number of real seconds describing an event, and it has to
// keep meaning that whatever the house tempo dial says. `speed` drives the
// medium, which is the thing that is still moving afterwards.
//
// AND AT REST IT IS STILL ALIVE. The opening arrives, the law goes quiet, and
// three fields keep drifting under it: the lip wanders, the sky inside turns,
// the air in the beam moves through. Nothing pulses. Settled here is a whisper,
// which is what the family asks for and what a frozen frame would not give.
//
//   c0 aperture  the rest radius of the opening.
//   c1 rim       how much light the material's own lip catches, and how defined
//                that lip is. High is stone with an edge; low is an opening in
//                something soft.
//   c2 beam      how far the admitted light carries into the medium outside.
//   c3 dust      how much fine air-structure the light shows. A density, and
//                the frequency is capped so it can never resolve into specks.

// MARK: - 7. Dapple

// DAPPLE. Canopy light, and the shade breathing across the floor.
//
// The mechanism is two layers of leaves, and it is the whole species. A canopy
// is not one screen with holes in it, it is a DEPTH of overlapping crowns, and
// light reaches the floor only where a gap in the near layer happens to line up
// with a gap in the far one. So the transmission here is a PRODUCT of two
// thresholded fields drifting at different rates and in different directions,
// and everything good about the picture follows from that product:
//
//   the patches are broad and irregular, because the intersection of two soft
//   regions is a soft region, and nothing in it is ever a cell or a dot
//   they appear and vanish where they are, rather than sliding in from the
//   edge, because two gaps come into alignment in place
//   and that is the BREATHING. Nothing here modulates brightness with time. The
//   shade breathes because the two layers are sliding past each other, which is
//   a coordinate being read, which is the family law
//
// Two layers and not three. Three would be more literally true of a real
// canopy, but the intersection of three random gap sets is small and scattered,
// and small scattered bright things are exactly the dots this package exists to
// avoid. The large scale comes from a separate broad crown field instead, which
// lifts and dims whole regions of floor without ever fragmenting them.
//
// WHY THE PATCHES ARE ROUND, which is the fact that makes dapple look like
// dapple. Each bright patch on a forest floor is not the shape of the gap above
// it: it is a PINHOLE IMAGE OF THE SUN, and the further the floor is from the
// canopy the more completely the gap's own shape is lost and the rounder and
// softer the patch becomes. That is what `depthLight` is. It widens the
// threshold (a wider penumbra) and lowers the canopy's effective frequency (a
// blurred projection) together, because in the real thing those are one effect.
// At zero the floor is right under the leaves and the patches wear the gaps'
// torn shapes; at one it is a long way below and they are soft warm ovals.
//
// This is the pack's other water-and-light style and it must never be confused
// with mg_caustic, so the two are built to be opposites: the caustic is a FINE
// WEB drawn as the zero set of a Jacobian, all line and no area; the dapple is
// BROAD AREA with no line in it anywhere.
//
//   c0 canopy      how fine the leaf mass is. Low is a few big crowns, high is
//                  a dense canopy with small gaps.
//   c1 breeze      how much the canopy moves: the layers' drift and the gust
//                  that sways them. The gust is positional, never luminous.
//   c2 patch       how open the canopy is, which is the threshold the gaps are
//                  cut at, which is how much floor is lit and how large the
//                  patches get.
//   c3 depthLight  how far the floor is below the leaves. The penumbra dial

// MARK: - 8. Eclipse

// ECLIPSE. A soft dark mass wandering across a light, and the corona at its limb
// doing all of the talking.
//
// THE READING OF THE BRIEF, stated so it can be checked. "Never fully covered
// and never fully free" is taken here to mean the PICTURE is always partial:
// there is always corona, so the light is never extinguished, and there is
// always a dark mass, so the light is never simply a light. The occluder's
// wander is bounded to guarantee both. It is a closed path around the light
// rather than a pass across it, which is also why this has no beginning and no
// end and therefore no arc: `epoch` is ignored.
//
// THE INVERSION, which is how this stays clear of its two neighbours at 76 pt.
// mg_oculus is bright in the middle with a dark surround. mg_lantern is a glow
// with no dark anywhere in it. This one is DARK IN THE MIDDLE with its light at
// the edge, which is the opposite composition to both, and the difference
// survives being shrunk to a gallery cell because it is a difference of where
// the black is rather than of what the texture does.
//
// THE CORONA IS NOT A RING, and three things stop it becoming one:
//
//   its reach is a function of ANGLE. The falloff length outside the limb is
//   modulated by a field evaluated on the unit circle, so the corona goes out in
//   plumes of very different lengths and its outer boundary is ragged. A corona
//   with one falloff length is an annulus, and an annulus is a graphic.
//   it is weighted by the LIGHT BEHIND IT. The occluder is offset from the
//   light, so one side of its limb has the light's bright middle behind it and
//   the opposite side has only the light's outskirts. That makes the corona
//   several times brighter on one side, which is the crescent, and it costs
//   nothing because the light field is already in hand.
//   the limb itself is TORN and soft, and it drifts.
//
// The occluder is never black either. A mass lit only by scattered light is
// still a mass; a mass at zero is a hole cut in the picture, and the eye reads
// the hole's edge as a drawn curve no matter how soft it is.
//
//   c0 occlude   how much of the light the mass takes, as a fraction of the
//                light's actual flux rather than as a radius in the abstract:
//                the mass grows and its wander tightens together, so at 0 it
//                takes about a sixth and at 1 about a half, and at the 0.5
//                default it wanders between roughly a quarter and two fifths
//                with a mid around a third. More coverage is more limb against
//                bright light, so more corona, which is why an eclipse gets more
//                dramatic rather than dimmer as it deepens.
//   c1 corona    the corona's brightness and how far its plumes reach.
//   c2 drift     how fast the mass travels its path, which is the rate at which
//                the bright crescent swings around the limb.
//   c3 softness  how soft the mass's edge is, and how much it is allowed to
//                move. This is the dial that decides between an object passing
//                in front of a light and a thickening in the same medium.

    // pixel INSIDE the limb, so `limb` was 1.0 across the entire interior and the
    // corona was being drawn at full strength over the very thing it is supposed
    // to be bleeding around. The mass was painting itself out, the frame read as
    // one bright warm disc, and that made it a twin of mg_oculus at every size.
    // The corona is light passing BESIDE the mass, so the mass occludes it like
    // everything else, and the gate below is not a cosmetic fix but the missing
    // half of the physics.
    // The weighting by the light standing behind this stretch of limb is where
    // the crescent comes from and why it swings as the mass wanders. The
    // coefficient is down from 1.6 to 0.8 because with the interior no longer

    // none of the other seven can. The mass is untouched: it is not a light, so
