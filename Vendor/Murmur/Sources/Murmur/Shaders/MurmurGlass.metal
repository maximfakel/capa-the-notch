// The Glass pack. The hero collection, and the answer to the verdict that killed
// the first forty-eight: "they just don't feel high quality yet."
//
// THE LESSON OF THE REFERENCE CLASS. The Siri and ChatGPT voice orbs do not
// differentiate by silhouette. Every one of them is the same soft volumetric
// glass body; what changes between them is what is happening INSIDE. The first
// forty-eight species went the other way -- each one invented its own shape, and
// forty-eight shapes is a grid of experiments rather than a collection. So this
// family has exactly ONE body, written once and carefully below, and twelve
// interiors. The body is the product. The heroes are what it is thinking about.
//
//   mh_aura     two or three wide soft ribbons of coloured light drifting
//               INSIDE the volume, crossing each other at different depths.
//   mh_droplet  the deformation hero: a zero-g liquid sphere wobbling, breathing
//               with voice, nearly clear around a soft luminous core.
//   mh_limn     near-dark glass whose EDGE is alive: a travelling arc of rim
//               light with a soft tail, never a full even ring.
//   mh_comet    one bright point on a tilted three-dimensional orbit inside,
//               trailing light that curves with the volume.
//   mh_nebula   the volumetric showcase: no object at all, just weather. Mist
//               folding slowly, lit from within so near folds silhouette
//               against the deep glow, with a glint buried in it.
//   mh_prism    light entering where the highlight says it does and fanning
//               into three soft diverging shafts, one hue each.
//   mh_duet     two luminous bodies orbiting a common centre, one warm of the
//               anchor and one cool, passing in front of and behind each other.
//   mh_still    the discipline piece: a nearly clear sphere whose rim and
//               catchlight are the figure, crossed by one slow glint.
//   mh_fathom   nested translucent shells, solved rather than marched, each
//               folded and turning at its own rate: depth you can count.
//   mh_arc      one soft bright filament arcing through the volume, anchored
//               near the core and never touching the shell.
//   mh_opal     play-of-colour: four soft flashes born and absorbed slowly, at
//               four points across the widest spread in the collection.
//   mh_flux     an aurora streaming inside the glass: curtains standing on a
//               bright foot, bending as they go.
//
// WHAT THE BODY KIT IS, and why each part of it is there. Seven things separate a
// glass presence from a painted disc, and a species that skips any one of them
// looks like a sticker no matter how good its interior is:
//
//   1. A DEFORMED SDF SPHERE. mh_deform sums three low-order modes -- sines of
//      the dot product with three slowly rotating axes, wavenumbers 1.7, 2.6 and
//      3.4, so roughly one and a half to three lobes across the body. Low order
//      matters: a high-frequency surface is a golf ball, and the eye reads it as
//      texture rather than as a soft body that is slightly out of round. Every
//      hero carries at least a whisper of it (0.022) because a mathematically
//      perfect sphere is the single most obvious tell that something was drawn
//      by a formula. Droplet turns it to 0.064, and gains its SHADING up
//      further still, which is what a body allowed to look liquid needs.
//
//   2. A REAL INTERIOR. Five taps along the view ray between the entry point and
//      the exit, sampling a THREE-DIMENSIONAL field, accumulated front to back
//      with transmittance so near content occludes far. This is the whole
//      argument of the family: interior content that parallaxes as the body
//      turns cannot be faked by painting on a disc, and the eye knows within
//      about a second which one it is looking at.
//
//   3. REFRACTION AT ENTRY. The ray does not go straight in. mh_refract bends it
//      toward the normal by Snell's law at a gentle 1.20 index, which does
//      nothing at the centre (the normal faces the viewer, so there is no angle
//      to bend) and everything at the limb, where it drags the ray across the
//      body and compresses the interior into the edge. That compression is what
//      makes a sphere look like it is FULL of something. Without it the interior
//      reads as a decal even with the depth march intact -- this was the single
//      biggest step up in the whole file.
//
//   4. A FRESNEL RIM THAT IS NOT A RING. Edge light rises as pow(1 - N.z, 3.9),
//      so it lives in the outer eighth of the body, and it is then weighted by
//      direction: brighter on the side away from the key. An even rim is a
//      stroked circle; an uneven one is a body in a room. It rides the DEFORMED
//      normal, so on droplet the rim traces the wobble.
//
//   5. ONE SPECULAR AND A CONTACT GLOW. Two lobes -- a tight one at 96 and a
//      broad sheen at 4 -- from one key up and to the left that drifts a few
//      degrees over half a minute, plus a barely-there bloom outside the
//      silhouette that pools slightly beneath. The specular is what reaches the
//      rail's cream stop; per the value hierarchy, a cell whose brightest pixel
//      is rust has failed, and on a glass body the highlight is the honest place
//      for the brightest pixel to be.
//
//   6. ABSORPTION. MH_EXT gives the glass a base extinction per unit of path, so
//      the far side of the body is genuinely dimmer than the near side. It is
//      one constant and it bought more depth than any other line in the file: it
//      is what makes a ribbon passing behind the middle read as passing BEHIND
//      rather than merely crossing.
//
//   7. THE FRESNEL SPLIT. mh_transmit weights the interior by how square the
//      view is to the surface, so near the limb almost nothing gets through.
//      That is what puts a real boundary between a bright reflective rim and the
//      content behind it, which is the contrast the reference orbs have and
//      which no amount of rim brightness produces on its own. It also kills the
//      inverted ghost a sphere lenses out of its own interior near the limb --
//      on comet that ghost had been reading as a second comet.
//
// THE MOTION LAW. Nothing here ticks. Every travelling phase goes through
// mh_drift, which is a rate plus the integral of a slow sinusoidal modulation of
// that rate: the closed form is theta = w*t + (k*w/w2)*sin(w2*t), whose
// derivative is w*(1 + k*cos(w2*t)) and is therefore strictly positive for
// k < 1 -- it speeds up and slows down and never stops or reverses. Every
// breath goes through mh_breath, which sums two periods (9.4 s and 14.7 s) that
// share no multiple the eye can find, so the body is always mid-breath and never
// at the top or bottom of a cycle you could count. Each hero's phases are given
// different lanes so no two of its motions agree, which is the difference
// between a presence and a mechanism.
//
// THE HUE SPREAD, and why the rail got its one extension. The reference orbs let
// two or three neighbouring hues interplay inside the glass, and that is a large
// part of why they look expensive. The hard rule is one hue family per
// configuration and the rail exists to enforce it, so the extension is made
// where it cannot go wrong: mh_shade walks the copied three-segment rail exactly
// as before and then ROTATES the resulting OKLAB chroma vector by an angle. L
// and C are untouched, so a spread colour is the same lightness and the same
// saturation as the anchor -- it cannot go muddy, because muddy is what happens
// when chroma is traded for hue. The cap is 0.50 radians, about 29 degrees each
// way: amber to gold on one side and amber to ember on the other. At hue = 0 the
// rotation is the identity and the rail is bit-for-bit the copied one. `spread`
// is c3 on every hero and each spends it on the axis that means something in its
// own physics: aura on which ribbon, comet on the age of the trail, limn on the
// distance behind the arc's head, droplet on depth through the body.
//
// SIZE. Three mounts, and the middle one is not the design target: an 18 pt
// inline field, a 46 pt chip, a 120 pt voice stage. mh_small is the dial and
// every hero spends it the same way -- STRUCTURE COUNTS DOWN, STROKES THICKEN,
// FINE FREQUENCIES SWITCH OFF. At 18 pt aura is two thick ribbons, droplet is a
// wobbling body around one big core, limn is a broad comma of rim light, and
// comet is a spark circling on a wider orbit. What survives is one bold gesture.
// At 120 pt the third ribbon, the granulation, the interior hint and the fine
// trail all come back, and they are what makes the large mount worth watching.
//
// THE CLIP IS A HARD BOUNDARY AND THE BODY RESPECTS IT. The view clips to a
// circle at length(uv) = 0.5. The body sits at MH_R = 0.300 with its
// displacement capped at 8.5 per cent and, on droplet, a voice swell capped at
// 5 per cent on top of that, so the worst case silhouette is 0.339 and the
// containment does not begin to fall until 0.36. The contact glow is allowed to
// run into that falloff because it is a soft gradient meeting another soft
// gradient; the BODY never is, because a sliced glass sphere is the one failure
// nobody would forgive. The body's radius is deliberately NOT driven by
// formScale for the same reason: the silhouette is this family's identity and it
// is not a dial. formScale scales the interior forms, which is where it means
// something anyway.
//
// PLAY, AND WHERE IT LIVES. From the second batch on every hero performs one
// gesture: a thing the presence does now and then and then lets go of. Nebula
// buries a glint in its weather, prism's fan opens wider than it otherwise ever
// does and sends a pulse down the shafts, duet's pair draws close and hurries
// once around each other, and still's single crossing glint IS its whole
// species. mh_flourish times them -- slots with a hashed onset inside each, so
// the gaps are never equal and there is nothing for the eye to count -- and it
// is deterministic, because a gesture that depends on when the app happened to
// start is a gesture the screenshot rig cannot reproduce.
//
// TWO GROUNDS, ONE FAMILY. The shader is handed the ground it will sit on, and
// on a light one nearly every rule above turns over. There is nowhere brighter
// than paper for energy to go, so the rail descends instead of climbing: content
// becomes CHROMA AND SHADOW rather than light, which is what a tinted
// transparent object actually does to what is behind it. The body goes pale
// -- clear glass on a page is almost nothing plus an edge -- the rim becomes the
// fine dark refracted edge rather than a glow, the contact bloom becomes a
// contact shadow pooled beneath, and the specular leaves the energy sum
// altogether to be composited as the one thing in the frame brighter than the
// page. mh_paper reads the ground's OKLAB lightness and everything downstream
// MIXES on it rather than branching, so a mid grey lands somewhere both rails
// agree on and a designer dragging the ink from ink to paper never sees a jump.
// At paper = 0 every one of those terms is algebraically the identity, which is
// how the twelve heroes reviewed on ink are unchanged to the bit.
//
// EPOCH IS IGNORED. None of the twelve is an arc species: a glass presence is
// always on, it does not arrive and settle. Every hero is complete, alive and
// worth a screenshot at level = 0, activity = 0 and state = idle, because that
// is the frame a gallery catches and the state a silent app sits in for hours.
//
// COPIED HELPERS. Cross-file Metal linkage is not guaranteed, so the kit is

// Their comments come with them: the reasoning is the part worth carrying.
// mh_shade is the copied rail plus the documented hue rotation above, and

/// as one material with twelve things happening inside it.
///
/// THE ARGUMENTS SPLIT because the light ground needs them to. On ink, the
/// interior, the rim, the specular and the contact bloom are all light and all
/// belong in one energy: sum them, walk the rail, done -- which is exactly what
/// happens below when `paper` is zero, bit for bit as the first eight heroes
/// were reviewed. On paper two of the four stop being light:
///
///   THE SPECULAR IS THE ONLY THING BRIGHTER THAN THE PAGE. Everything else in
///   the picture is the page minus something. So it leaves the energy sum -- if
///   it stayed, the descending rail would render the brightest thing in the
///   frame as the darkest -- and comes back as a small mix toward a warm white
///   pushed a little past 1, so it clips crisply against the pale body it sits
///   on. That body being pale is what makes it visible; a catchlight needs a
///   surround, not a brightness.
///
///   THE CONTACT BLOOM BECOMES A CONTACT SHADOW. Light spilling into ink is a
///   glow; the same term on paper is what an object occludes, so it turns into a
///   soft neutral darkening of the page and is weighted further downward, the
///   way a shadow pools under a thing rather than around it. `below` is read
///   from uv rather than from the body, because a shadow belongs to the ground
///   and not to the sphere.
///
/// THE KNEE MOVES with the ground too. At 0.90 it exists to stop a bright field
/// becoming flat white paper -- but when the ground already IS paper, sitting at
/// about 0.91 in linear light, that same knee spends all its headroom on the
/// page and leaves the catchlight nowhere to go. At 0.96 the page passes through
/// almost untouched and the highlight still compresses rather than clipping
/// hard.
///
/// `hue` is the spread offset the hero accumulated, already weighted by which
/// part of the picture is carrying colour: a pixel that is mostly specular gets
/// almost none of it, because a highlight is the colour of the light rather than
/// the colour of the thing it landed on.

// MARK: - 1. Aura

// AURA. Ribbons of coloured light, drifting slowly INSIDE the glass.
//
// THE SPECIES IS ABOUT DEPTH, and the test it has to pass is that the ribbons
// cross in front of and behind one another rather than sliding past each other
// in a plane. Each ribbon is an open SHEET: a gently rippling surface passing
// right through the body, thin through its thickness, wide across its face,
// displaced along its own frame's normal and rolled and tilted differently from
// the others. The interior march then does the rest for free -- a tap that lands
// in a near sheet attenuates what the far ones contribute behind it, so the
// crossings resolve as occlusion rather than as addition. Addition is what a
// painted disc does and it looks like coloured smoke; occlusion looks like two
// surfaces at two depths.
//
// WHY SHEETS AND NOT LOOPS. The build this species started from put each ribbon
// at a fixed cylindrical radius around a tilted axis -- a closed loop, which is
// the obvious way to say "circulating inside a sphere" and which cost three
// rounds before the reason it could not work became clear. A loop projects to an
// ellipse, and a band of finite thickness laid on an ellipse has two places
// where it turns edge-on to the viewer and pinches to nearly nothing. Those
// pinches are corners. Widening the band leaves corners; softening its edges
// leaves corners; slowing it down leaves corners that move slowly. It read as
// calligraphy every time, because a stroke with a sharp turn in it IS
// calligraphy, and diffusing the edges does not change what the centreline is
// doing. A sheet has no turns because it has no ends inside the volume: it
// enters one side of the glass and leaves the other, the way a length of silk
// hanging in water does. What that gives up is the loop's literal circulation.
// What it buys is that every part of the ribbon is a broad soft surface.
//
// LEVEL LIFTS AND QUICKENS THEM. Voice deepens the ripple (the sheets rise and
// fall further as they cross, so they sweep more depth), speeds their travel,
// and brightens them. All three at once, because a ribbon that only got brighter
// would read as a dimmer being turned and one that only got faster would read as
// a frame-rate change; the combination reads as the material getting more
// energetic, which is what a voice does to it.
//
// ACTIVITY ADDS A FINE SHIMMER along them: a high-frequency field sampled in the
// volume, gated by mh_aa so it switches itself off at the sizes where it would
// be moire. One noise per tap for all the sheets, not one per sheet, which is
// why this species is affordable.
//
// RESPONDING PUTS THEM IN FORMATION. The tilts converge halfway toward a common
// one and the travel roughly doubles, so ribbons drifting at their own angles
// become ribbons streaming together. Only halfway, and the ROLLS do not converge
// at all: collapsing every orientation onto one made the sheets coincident, and
// coincident sheets are one bright clot rather than a stream.
//
// SUCCESS IGNITES THEM ALONG THEIR LENGTH: a bright band runs once around the
// body on the state's sweep -- the ignition travels, it does not flash in place
// -- and the whole interior lifts under it and then settles brighter.
//
// SPREAD (c2) puts each ribbon on its own hue: one rotated warm, one rotated
// cool, the third at the far end. At spread 0 they are all the anchor and the
// species still works; at 0.5 they are neighbours in conversation, which is the
// reference-orb look and the reason this knob exists.
//
// SIZE: two ribbons is the default composition and the third is what c0 buys,
// so the small mounts are not counting down from a crowd -- they drop the third
// entirely, take the second to a third of its weight, and thicken what is left
// by 85 per cent. At 18 pt what survives is one broad swath of light crossing a
// filled body, which is the species said in one mark.

// MARK: - 2. Droplet

// DROPLET. The body itself is the species: a sphere of water in free fall.
//
// THIS IS THE ONE HERO WHERE THE SHELL DOES THE TALKING, so everything the other
// three keep at a whisper is turned up and everything they put inside is turned
// down. The deformation runs at 0.075 against their 0.022, the shading gain runs
// at 2.4 against their 1.35, and the interior is very nearly clear: one soft
// luminous core, a little haze, nothing else. A clear interior is not an empty
// one -- it is what lets the refraction be visible, because the only way to see
// a lens is to see something through it, and here the something is the core.
//
// THE HEART IS CENTRED, and only just off it. A whisper of lag -- under three
// per cent of the radius, on three incommensurate periods -- so the light is
// never nailed to the exact middle and the drop still reads as liquid carrying
// its contents a beat behind. Any more than that and it stops being the body's
// heart and becomes a lamp rattling around inside a shell. It is solved at the
// view ray's closest approach rather than sampled by the march, which is what
// makes it ROUND: five taps through an object this small drew the shape of the
// sampling instead of the shape of the object, and that read as a smear.
//
// LEVEL IS AN INHALE. Voice swells the whole body -- radius up by up to five per
// cent, on top of the deformation, which is why both are capped -- and raises
// the deformation with it, and brightens the core. The swell is shaped by a
// breath so it arrives and leaves on a curve rather than tracking the microphone
// sample by sample; a body that follows the raw envelope reads as a VU meter,
// and a body that lags it slightly reads as breathing.
//
// ACTIVITY IS TREMOR. Cadence gives the fourth deformation mode amplitude -- the
// one at wavenumber 6.9, drifting eight times faster than the body's own modes.
// Tiny surface ripples, the way a drop of water shivers when something touches
// its container. It is gated by mh_aa: at 18 pt a 6.9-mode ripple is under a
// pixel and would only be aliasing.
//
// RESPONDING GIVES THE WOBBLE A HEADING. mh_deform's travelling wave switches on
// and runs around the body in one direction at about a third of a hertz. A
// wobble that goes everywhere is thinking; a wave that goes one way is
// answering.
//
// SUCCESS IGNITES THE CORE AND PUSHES A SHELL OUT THROUGH THE BODY on the sweep
// -- the light arrives at the surface, lifts the rim, and settles. The interior
// ignites and settles, which is the family's law, said in the physics of a drop.
//
// SPREAD (c3, default 0.3) rides DEPTH here: content nearer the viewer takes one
// hue and content further takes the other, so the core seen through the front of
// the glass is a hair warmer than the same core's halo behind it. That is what
// dispersion looks like when it is behaving, and at 0.3 it is felt rather than
// seen.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the deformation is turned UP by a fifth (a small body needs a
// louder silhouette to read as anything but a circle), the tremor is off, and
// the core grows to nearly half the body so what survives is one clear gesture:
// a wobbling drop with a light in it.

// MARK: - 3. Limn

// LIMN. Near-dark glass whose EDGE is alive.
//
// THE SPECIES IS A NEGATIVE. Every other hero fills the volume and lets the rim
// finish it; this one empties the volume almost completely and puts everything
// into a single travelling arc of light on the silhouette. It exists because a
// collection of twelve luminous bodies needs one that is mostly dark -- on a
// gallery wall it is the one your eye goes to second and stays on, and in a chat
// UI it is the one that does not compete with the text.
//
// NEVER A FULL EVEN RING. That is the whole brief and it is enforced by the
// arc's profile: an ASYMMETRIC gaussian in the angle, tight ahead of the head
// (0.42 rad) and long behind it (1.15 rad), so what travels is a comma of light
// with a soft tail rather than a dot or a ring. The two halves meet at the peak
// where both slopes are zero, so the join is C1 and invisible. The tail is short
// enough that it has decayed to nothing by the time it wraps to pi, which is
// what keeps the arc from ever quietly becoming the ring it must not be.
//
// THE TRAVEL IS EASED, hard. mh_drift with a wobble of 0.62 means the arc
// hurries through part of its lap and dawdles through the rest -- a light going
// somewhere, not a light going round. At a constant rate this species was a
// spinner and nothing else.
//
// LEVEL THICKENS AND BRIGHTENS IT. Voice widens the radial band the arc lives
// in (up by 80 per cent), widens the head, and lifts the whole thing. A quiet
// room gets a thin bright scratch of light; a person talking gets a broad warm
// blade of it. That is the deepest reading of `level` in this batch and it is
// why this hero is here.
//
// ACTIVITY QUICKENS THE TRAVEL, and only that. Cadence is the rate of a stream
// and the arc's rate is the honest place to spend it.
//
// THE INTERIOR HOLDS ONLY A HINT of what the rim illuminates. The arc's position
// is a direction in three dimensions, so the inside of the glass glows faintly
// where that light would have entered: a dot product against the sample's own
// direction, cubed. It costs one line and it is the difference between a rim
// drawn ON a dark disc and a rim lighting a dark VOLUME.
//
// RESPONDING: the arc stops wandering. The eased travel flattens toward
// constant, the rate roughly doubles, and the tail stretches -- decisive, a
// single sustained sweep instead of a searching one.
//
// SUCCESS: the arc completes a full lap on the sweep and, at the moment of
// arrival, the rim briefly closes into the even ring it is otherwise never
// allowed to be. The presence's pattern is an incomplete circle; completing it
// is closing the circle. Then it opens again and settles brighter.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the head widens from 0.42 to 1.05 rad and the band thickens
// nearly threefold -- 0.09 body units is half a pixel at 18 pt -- so what
// survives is one broad comma of light sweeping a dark bead. The interior hint
// drops to almost nothing, because at 18 pt there is no interior to hint at.

// MARK: - 4. Comet

// COMET. One bright point on a tilted orbit inside the glass, trailing light.
//
// THE TRAIL IS NOT A HISTORY BUFFER. The obvious build -- remember where the
// point was and smear it -- is impossible here, because these shaders are
// stateless by contract: any `time` has to render the correct frame or the
// screenshot rig and the scrub slider disagree with the app. So the trail is
// solved geometrically instead, and it is the nicest piece of arithmetic in the
// file. The orbit is a circle in a plane, so for any point in the volume the
// NEAREST POINT ON THAT CIRCLE is closed form: project into the plane's basis,
// pull the in-plane component out to the orbit radius, and the leftover is the
// distance to the tube. The angle of that nearest point, subtracted from the
// head's angle and wrapped, is exactly how long ago the head was there. Trail
// brightness is then a decay in that age. The result is a trail that follows the
// orbit's curvature perfectly, costs four dot products, and is correct at any
// time value including ones the app never rendered.
//
// THE ORBIT IS TILTED AND PRECESSES, which is the reason this hero is in the
// collection: the point goes BEHIND the core of the glass and comes back around
// the front, and the interior march makes that legible as depth because the
// haze in front of it dims it. A flat orbit would be a circle drawn on a disc
// and the species would be worthless.
//
// LEVEL SWELLS THE POINT'S LIGHT. Voice grows the head and its halo and lifts
// its brightness -- the point gets fatter and hotter, not faster. Speed is
// cadence's job, and keeping the two signals on different axes is what lets a
// person read which one is happening.
//
// ACTIVITY TIGHTENS THE ORBIT. Cadence pulls the radius in by up to a quarter
// and quickens the travel: a busy assistant's thought circles closer and faster.
// The two together read as winding up, which is the right feeling for a token
// stream.
//
// RESPONDING STRETCHES THE TRAIL toward a full ring and drives the rate up: the
// point stops being a spark going round and becomes a streak with a head, which
// is what "answering now" looks like in this grammar.
//
// SUCCESS IGNITES THE WHOLE ORBIT along the sweep -- the trail fills in behind
// the head all the way round, the head flares, and it settles back to a brighter
// spark. The ignition travels, which is the family law.
//
// SPREAD (c3, default 0.3) rides the trail's AGE: the head is the anchor hue and
// the trail cools toward a neighbour as it fades. It is the most literal use of
// the knob in this batch and the most legible.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the orbit radius grows from 0.54 to 0.66 of the body (a small
// orbit inside a small body is a jitter, not a circling), the head grows by
// half, the trail SHORTENS to about a third of a lap, and the fog drops by half
// so the spark keeps the contrast to be seen at all. What survives is exactly
// the brief: a clean spark circling.

// MARK: - 5. Nebula

// NEBULA. The volumetric showcase: there is no object in this glass at all.
//
// EVERY OTHER HERO PUTS SOMETHING INSIDE THE BODY and lets the medium carry it.
// This one deletes the something. The mist IS the species, and the whole design
// question is whether five samples down a refracted ray can make a cloud read as
// a cloud rather than as a soft gradient with noise on it. The answer turned out
// to be one structural decision plus one line of arithmetic.
//
// THE STRUCTURAL DECISION: THE MIST IS LIT FROM WITHIN, NOT UNIFORMLY. Emission
// rises toward the middle of the body and absorption does not, so what the eye
// gets is a deep glow with folds of denser material hanging in front of it. That
// is what makes a nebula a nebula -- the dark parts are dark because something
// is IN FRONT, not because nothing is there -- and a mist that emits evenly
// everywhere can never produce it however beautifully it folds.
//
// THE LINE OF ARITHMETIC is the transmittance: absorption is proportional to the
// same density that emits, at a coefficient high enough that a dense fold
// genuinely swallows what is behind it. Round-one heroes ran this low because
// their content was sparse. Here it is the whole point: NEARER FOLDS OCCLUDE
// FARTHER GLOW, and that sentence is a coefficient of 3.1.
//
// THE FOLDING is a domain warp: one noise displaces the coordinates the second
// noise is read at. Two samples per tap, which is the entire budget this species
// gets and the reason it can afford to be the only hero with real turbulence. A
// single octave read straight would be lumpy rather than folded, and an fBm deep
// enough to fold on its own would cost four times as much for a result the five
// taps would average away.
//
// ACTIVITY STIRS IT, which is the brief and also the honest mapping: cadence
// raises the WARP AMPLITUDE and the drift rate together, so a thinking assistant
// visibly churns its own weather rather than merely running the same clouds
// faster. LEVEL LIGHTS IT: voice lifts the deep glow and quickens the fold, so a
// room with somebody talking in it has a brighter, livelier interior.
//
// RESPONDING GIVES THE WEATHER A DIRECTION. A current switches on and the whole
// domain advects along one axis, so the mist stops churning in place and starts
// streaming. Turbulence with a heading is the only way this species can say
// "answering now" without abandoning its own physics.
//
// THE GESTURE, and it is buried on purpose: every seven seconds or so a glint
// lights somewhere inside the cloud and drifts a little way before fading. It is
// evaluated INSIDE the march rather than solved at closest approach, which is
// the opposite of what comet and droplet do and is deliberate -- a glint that is
// occluded by the mist in front of it is a glint that is inside the weather, and
// solving it outside the loop would paste it on top. Wide enough (0.13) that
// five taps resolve it without aliasing, which is what buys that.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the noise scale drops by nearly half so the features are large

// MARK: - 6. Prism

// PRISM. Light entering the glass and softly splitting inside it.
//
// THE ENTRY POINT IS NOT ARBITRARY, and this is the species' one non-negotiable.
// The shafts begin where the specular highlight is, because that is where the
// picture already says the light is coming from, and a prism whose beams enter
// somewhere else is a prism nobody believes for a second. mh_key is a shared
// function for exactly this reason: the highlight and the entry point read the
// same direction, including its slow drift, and they cannot come apart when
// either is tuned.
//
// SHAFTS, NEVER RAYS. Each beam is a soft cone rather than a line: a gaussian in
// the perpendicular distance to its axis, whose width GROWS with distance from
// the entry, plus the kit's scatter on the same argument. A beam of constant
// width is a laser and a laser is the failure mode named in the brief; a beam
// that opens as it travels is a shaft of light in a medium, which is what this
// is. The fade-in over the first fifth of the path is what keeps the entry from
// being a hard bright dot, and the fade-out before the far wall is what keeps
// the shafts from painting themselves onto the inside of the shell.
//
// THE SPLIT IS A FAN in one plane, which is what a prism does: three directions
// spread symmetrically about the axis, and `split` is the half-angle. The middle
// beam sits on the anchor hue and the outer two are rotated to either side, so
// SPREAD DOES REAL WORK HERE -- at spread 0.6 this species shows three
// neighbouring hues separated in space rather than mixed, which is the most
// literal use of the knob anywhere in the collection and the reason its default
// is the highest of the twelve.
//
// LEVEL OPENS THE APERTURE: voice brightens the shafts and widens them, so more
// light is entering the glass when somebody is speaking. ACTIVITY RUNS DOWN
// THEM: cadence puts a travelling brightness along the shafts' length, gated by
// mh_aa so it switches itself off at the sizes where it would only be moire.
//
// RESPONDING CONVERGES THEM. The fan closes toward a single strong shaft driving
// through the body, brighter and straighter than the three were. A split that
// gathers itself into one beam is this species' way of saying "answering now",
// and it is the exact inverse of the gesture below, which is the point.
//
// THE GESTURE: every nine seconds or so the fan opens wider than it ever
// otherwise does and a bright pulse runs down the shafts to the far side. Light
// being worked on.
//
// SUCCESS: the pulse runs down every beam at once on the state's sweep and the
// whole bundle lifts, then settles brighter. The ignition travels, per the law.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the third beam crossfades away and the remaining two are nearly
// twice as wide -- a 0.05 body-unit shaft is under a pixel down there and would
// alias into a dotted line -- the travelling shimmer is gone, and the fan opens
// wider so the two are unmistakably two. What survives is a wide soft wedge of
// light entering a warm bead, which is the species in one gesture.

// MARK: - 7. Duet

// DUET. Two lights orbiting a common centre inside the glass: the conversation.
//
// TWO THINGS IN ONE VOLUME IS A DEPTH PROBLEM, and solving it properly is the
// whole species. Two bright blobs going round each other on a flat disc is a
// loading spinner; two bodies passing in front of and behind one another with
// the far one visibly dimmer and partly eaten by the near one is a conversation
// happening in a space. Three separate mechanisms produce that and each is one
// line:
//
//   THE ORBIT IS TILTED and precesses, so the pair's plane is never edge-on for
//   long and never face-on at all. Face-on is the spinner; edge-on is a line.
//   THE FAR ONE IS DIMMER. Both bodies are solved at the view ray's closest
//   approach, so each knows how deep into the glass it is, and exp(-MH_EXT * s)
//   does the rest -- the one at the back is seen through more material and comes
//   out at a third of the light.
//   THE NEAR ONE OCCLUDES THE FAR ONE. Whichever body the ray reaches first
//   attenuates the other by its own density at this pixel. That is the cue that
//   turns "dimmer" into "behind", and without it the pair reads as two lamps at
//   different brightnesses rather than as two objects at two depths.
//
// SOLVED, NOT SAMPLED, for the same reason droplet's heart is: bodies this
// compact marched at five steps come out as the shape of the sampling. Two dot
// products each, exact at every distance, and perfectly round from any angle.
//
// SPREAD IS THE TWO VOICES. One body sits a little warm of the anchor and the
// other a little cool of it, which is why this species carries the collection's
// joint-highest default: the difference between the two lights IS the content,
// and at spread 0 it degrades to two identical lamps, which is a duet with both
// parts written in unison.
//
// LEVEL SHIFTS THE BALANCE, and this is the reading of `level` the species
// exists for. At rest the glow sways slowly between the two -- turn and turn
// about, the conversation ticking over. As voice comes up it pushes decisively
// toward one of them: somebody has the floor. Not both brighter, which would say
// nothing; brighter THERE and dimmer here, which says who is speaking.
//
// ACTIVITY TIGHTENS AND QUICKENS the orbit a little, the way a busy exchange
// closes the distance between two people.
//
// RESPONDING BRAIDS THEM. The separation collapses by a third, the rate nearly
// doubles, and a weave switches on: each body is displaced along the orbit's own
// normal by a term running at three times the orbital rate and in opposite
// signs, so they wind around each other rather than merely circling faster. A
// braid is two things becoming one line without merging, which is exactly what a
// conversation in full flow looks like.
//
// THE GESTURE: every eight seconds or so the pair draws close and hurries once
// around each other before easing back out. Play, in this species' own grammar.
//
// SUCCESS: they rush together, the interior ignites as they meet, and they ease
// apart again brighter. The pattern is two things circling; completing it is
// their arrival at the same place.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the orbit opens from 0.41 to 0.56 of the body (a tight orbit in
// a small bead is a wobble, not two objects), both bodies grow by half, and the
// size ratio is pushed toward one so the smaller companion cannot vanish. What
// survives is two clean sparks turning around each other, which is the least the
// species can be and still be itself.

// MARK: - 8. Still

// STILL. The discipline piece: a quiet glass sphere and one slow glint.
//
// THE WHOLE BRIEF IS ONE SENTENCE -- intentional minimalism, never unfinished --
// and the distance between those two things is not a matter of adding or
// removing content. It is entirely the QUALITY OF THE RIM and the COMPOSURE OF
// THE GLINT. A nearly empty sphere with a mediocre edge reads as a hero that did
// not get finished; the same emptiness behind a beautifully turned rim reads as
// restraint. So this species spends almost its whole energy budget on the two
// things the kit does best and adds nearly nothing of its own.
//
// THE RIM AND SPECULAR RUN THE HIGHEST IN THE COLLECTION, and they are the
// figure rather than the finish: the specular is the brightest pixel in the
// frame by a wide margin and the rim carries the silhouette on its own. Every
// other hero has to keep those two in check so its interior can be seen. This
// one has no interior to protect, which is exactly the licence it needs.
//
// THE GLINT IS ONE THING, AND IT ARRIVES ON ITS OWN SCHEDULE. Every ten seconds
// or so -- the flourish clock's slot at the default `glintRate`, jittered so no
// two gaps match -- a small soft light crosses the volume, entering on one side
// and leaving by the other, brightening and fading on a curve with flat ends so
// it never begins and never stops. It is solved at the view ray's closest
// approach, which on this species matters more than on any other: it is the only
// event in the frame, so any flicker or smear in it is the whole picture
// failing. Composure means it is perfectly round, moves at an eased rate, and is
// gone before you have finished watching it.
//
// PRESENCE (c2) LIFTS A FAINT INTERIOR FLOOR, and it is the dial between the two
// readings. At zero the glass is optically empty and the species is at its most
// severe; at one there is a soft warmth in the body that makes the sphere read
// as full even between glints. CLARITY (c1) works against it: a clearer glass
// carries less of everything, so the two knobs together are the whole range from
// a dark bead with a bright edge to a warm one with a light asleep in it.
//
// LEVEL IS ATTENTION, NOT MOTION. Voice lifts the rim and the floor and
// brightens the glint, and that is deliberately all: a minimal presence that
// starts moving when somebody speaks is not minimal any more, it is just quiet
// until it is not. ACTIVITY QUICKENS THE GLINT'S CADENCE a little, so a busy
// assistant's one light comes round more often.
//
// RESPONDING is where the species drops its aperiodicity. The glints come nearly
// three times as fast and their paths converge on a single axis, so what was an
// occasional wander becomes a steady traverse across the body. Regular is
// exactly what idle must never be and exactly what answering should be.
//
// SUCCESS: a soft bloom rises from the middle and settles, and the glint that
// happens to be crossing brightens with it. The quietest arrival in the family,
// which is the right one for this hero.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the glint grows by four fifths and the floor lifts by half,
// because a nearly empty bead thirteen points across with nothing in it reads as
// a bug rather than as restraint. The specular's exponent falls from 96 to 16 in
// the kit, which spreads the same light over two or three pixels -- and on this
// species, where the highlight IS the figure, that is the single most important
// size adaptation in the file.

// MARK: - 9. Fathom

// FATHOM. Layered translucent depths: nested shells, seen through each other.
//
// NOT MIST, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DISTINCTION FROM NEBULA. Nebula's answer to
// depth is a cloud whose near folds silhouette against its own glow -- volume
// without any surface in it. This species goes the other way: three legible
// SURFACES at three radii, each one a thin translucent skin you can see the next
// one through. What the eye gets from a cloud is atmosphere; what it gets from
// nested shells is measurement, a sense of how far in the far one is, which is
// the species' name.
//
// THE SHELLS ARE SOLVED, NOT MARCHED, and that is what makes them legible. A
// shell is a thin surface, and five samples down a ray would catch it or miss it
// depending on where the tap planes happened to fall -- the same failure that
// cost comet its head and droplet its heart, except six times over. So each
// shell's crossings are found by intersecting the interior ray with a sphere,
// which is one quadratic: a ray that enters the body crosses every shell it
// reaches exactly twice, once going in and once coming out.
//
// AND THEY SORT THEMSELVES. Six crossings would normally have to be depth-sorted
// before they could be composited, which is not something a fragment shader
// wants to do. But the order is known in advance and cannot vary: a ray entering
// from outside meets the biggest shell first, then the middle, then the
// smallest, then the smallest again on the way out, then the middle, then the
// biggest. Outer-in, inner-out. So the accumulation is simply written in that
// sequence and the transmittance is correct with no sorting at all.
//
// GRAZING CROSSINGS GLOW, and this is the effect that sells translucency. The
// amount of material a ray meets crossing a thin shell is its thickness divided
// by the cosine of the angle between the ray and the surface, so a crossing near
// a shell's own limb passes through several times as much skin as one through
// its face. Each shell therefore wears a bright rim of its own, nested inside
// the last -- and it is free, because the cosine is a dot product the crossing
// already computed. The floor at 0.26 caps the amplification, because the exact
// grazing case divides by zero.
//
// THE FOLDS CATCH LIGHT. Each shell carries two low-order modes on its surface,
// rotating at its own rate, and they do two things at once: they displace the
// crossing along the ray by a first-order correction, so the shell is genuinely
// out of round and the near and far crossings disagree about where it is, and
// they modulate how much the skin catches the key. THE PARALLAX IS REAL because
// each shell turns at a different rate: watch any point of the front shell's
// fold and the pattern behind it slides the other way.
//
// LEVEL PUSHES THEM APART. Voice separates the radii, which opens up the space
// between the layers and makes the depth cue stronger, and deepens the folds.
// Not brighter -- deeper. ACTIVITY QUICKENS THE INDEPENDENT ROTATIONS, so the
// parallax between the layers animates faster: a thinking assistant's depths
// slide past each other.
//
// RESPONDING ALIGNS THE ROTATIONS and drives them one way, so three layers
// sliding independently become three layers travelling together.
//
// THE GESTURE, every nine seconds or so: the shells breathe apart and back.
//
// SUCCESS IGNITES THEM FROM THE INSIDE OUT, one layer at a time along the
// state's sweep -- the innermost first, then the middle, then the outer. An
// arrival that arrives THROUGH something is what this species has that the
// others do not.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the third shell crossfades away and the two that remain are
// nearly twice as thick and half as folded, because a fold four pixels across is
// a wobble rather than a fold. What survives is two nested translucent rings,
// which is the species stated in the fewest surfaces it can have and still be
// about depth.

// MARK: - 10. Arc

// ARC. One soft bright filament arcing gently through the volume.
//
// THE SPECIES IS A LINE, and a line is the hardest thing this kit has been asked
// to draw. Everything else in the collection is either compact enough to solve
// at the ray's closest approach -- a point, a heart, a pair of bodies, a flash
// -- or broad enough that five samples average it honestly: ribbons, mist,
// curtains, shells. A filament is neither. It is thin enough that a march steps
// straight over it, and extended enough that there is no closed form for a
// ray's nearest approach to it.
//
// THE FIRST BUILD MARCHED IT AT TEN STEPS and the verdict on it was a fat slug
// of light, which was correct and which the march had made unavoidable. A
// sampled filament cannot be thinner than its sampling: at ten steps down a
// two-unit chord the interval is 0.2, so a tube narrower than that is caught by
// whichever tap happens to fall inside it and missed otherwise, and what draws
// is a line that is dim, uneven, and flickering as it moves. The only way to
// make ten taps honest was to widen the thread to 0.125 of the sphere's radius,
// which is a bolster. Sixteen taps would have bought 0.08 -- still not a thread
// -- at three times the cost.
//
// SO THE FILAMENT IS NOT MARCHED AT ALL. It is integrated in closed form, and
// the argument has three steps.
//
//   THE PROBLEM MOVES INTO THE ARC'S FRAME FOR FREE, because rotations are
//   linear: the ray's origin and direction go through the same roll and spin the
//   curve is defined in, and the direction stays unit because a rotation cannot
//   stretch it. In that frame the arc is a plain circle in a plane.
//   THE SEARCH RUNS ALONG THE CURVE, NOT THE RAY. For any point on the arc the
//   ray's closest approach to it is two dot products, so twenty samples along
//   the curve plus a parabolic refinement find where the ray passes nearest the
//   filament. Searching a smooth one-dimensional function is what makes this
//   stable: the samples slide continuously as the geometry moves, so nothing
//   pops, where sampling the ray made the answer depend on where the taps fell.
//   THE INTEGRAL IS THEN EXACT. Locally the curve is a straight line, and a
//   gaussian tube crossed by a ray at angle alpha integrates to w * sqrt(pi) /
//   sin(alpha) times the gaussian of the perpendicular distance.
//
// Once the sampling constraint is gone the width is a free design decision
// again, which is the whole point of the rewrite: at 0.052 the thread is five
// per cent of the sphere's radius, about five pixels at 120 pt and two at 18,
// and it is that because that is what reads as calligraphic -- not because
// anything downstream needs it to be.
//
// THE SPINDLE. Width and brightness fall away from the middle together, on one
// profile, so the thread is thickest and brightest at its centre and vanishes to
// a point at each tip. Brightness falls faster than width does, which reads as a
// stroke laid down with pressure in the middle and lifted at both ends. A
// filament of even width with a fade painted on its ends is a rod that got
// dimmer; one that NARROWS as it dims is a stroke.
//
// TWO CROSSINGS, because a shallow U seen from most angles is crossed twice --
// once through each limb -- and a global minimum would find only one and break
// the thread where it passes over itself. The arc is searched in halves and both
// winners contribute, with the second faded out by how far apart the two answers
// are, so the apex does not render at double brightness when both halves
// converge on it.
//
// CORE PIN (c2) IS THE ARC'S CLOSEST APPROACH TO THE CENTRE, and it is the knob
// the species is really about. At 1 the filament passes right through the core
// and the presence reads as one bright line struck through its own middle; at 0
// it bows well clear and reads as a thread hung across the volume. Everything
// between is the interesting part. THE ARC NEVER TOUCHES THE SHELL: its geometry
// is chosen so both ends land inside 0.70 at every setting of the knobs, which
// is comfortably inside mh_inside's fade, so it is a filament in glass rather
// than a wire soldered to the inside of it.
//
// LEVEL PUTS ENERGY IN THE LINE: voice brightens the filament and BOWS IT
// FURTHER, the way a plucked string carries more amplitude when it carries more
// energy. ACTIVITY RUNS CURRENT ALONG IT: a travelling brightness down the arc's
// length, gated by mh_aa so it retires itself at the sizes where a cycle would
// be under two pixels.
//
// RESPONDING PULLS IT TAUT. The bow flattens toward a straight chord and the
// travelling pulse becomes strong and regular: a slack thread going tight is
// about as legible a picture of "answering now" as a single line can make.
//
// THE GESTURE, every eight seconds or so: the arc bows deeper and a glimmer runs
// its whole length.
//
// SUCCESS: one bright pulse travels the filament end to end on the state's
// sweep, the whole line lifts under it, and it settles brighter.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the thread thickens by 90 per cent to hold the same pixel
// count, the span shortens by a fifth so what is left is a clean short curve
// rather than a long thin one, and the travelling current switches off. The
// closed-form integral scales with WIDTH, so the gain is cut by roughly the
// reciprocal of that widening -- without it the small mounts came out three
// times brighter than the large one. What survives is one soft bright stroke
// bowing inside a bead.

    // For any point C on the curve, the ray's closest approach to it is two dot

    // With the nearest point known, the integral is closed form. Locally the

// MARK: - 11. Opal

// OPAL. Internal play-of-colour: soft flashes drifting through the volume.
//
// NO STROBE, EVER, and that is the constraint the whole species is built around.
// Play-of-colour in a real opal is not a flicker; it is a slow shifting of where
// the light is coming from as the stone turns, and the eye reads it as depth
// rather than as an event. So every flash here is BORN AND ABSORBED SLOWLY: each
// one rides its own life envelope on a period between fourteen and twenty-two
// seconds, out of phase with the others, so no two arrive together and none of
// them ever appears or vanishes -- they come up out of the glass and go back
// into it. The envelope also has a floor rather than a zero, so a flash at its
// dimmest is still faintly present and there is no moment of switching on.
//
// FOUR FLASHES, SOLVED AT CLOSEST APPROACH. They are compact bodies, so five
// marched samples would draw the shape of the sampling; two dot products each
// draws the shape of the flash, perfectly round from any angle and stable as it
// moves. Each carries the kit's scatter at a generous amplitude, because a
// flash inside an opal is mostly the glow it throws into the stone around it
// rather than the bright centre -- the scatter is the species here, not a
// finish on it.
//
// SPREAD DOES ITS WIDEST WORK, which is why this hero carries the collection's
// highest default and the one internal multiplier above the family cap. The four
// flashes sit at four points across the spread -- two either side of the anchor
// -- and at the default they are already four distinguishable neighbours. The
// multiplier takes the extremes to about thirty-seven degrees of OKLAB hue at
// spread 1, which is amber to gold on one side and amber to ember on the other:
// still one hue family by the rail's own definition, still nothing that could be
// called a second colour, and the widest this collection ever goes. Play-of-
// colour is the species; anywhere else this would be too much.
//
// LEVEL BLOOMS THEM: voice grows each flash and brightens it, so a room with
// somebody in it has a stone with more fire. ACTIVITY QUICKENS THE DRIFT, and
// only the drift -- cadence moves the flashes around, it does not light them,
// because the two signals doing different things is what lets a person read
// which one is happening.
//
// RESPONDING TURNS THEM INTO A PROCESSION. The drift directions align and the
// flashes brighten in sequence along that axis, so what was four lights waking
// at random becomes a wave of colour crossing the volume one way.
//
// SUCCESS: all four ignite together and settle, which is the only moment in the
// species where they are ever in phase -- and it reads as an event precisely
// because nothing else here ever is.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt two flashes crossfade away and the two that remain are 70 per
// cent larger, because four soft blobs in a thirteen-point bead is a texture and
// two is a composition. What survives is one warm light and one cool one moving
// slowly past each other, which is play-of-colour said in two marks.

// MARK: - 12. Flux

// FLUX. An aurora streaming inside the glass.
//
// THE ONE HERO ALLOWED A BROAD FLOWING FIELD, and it needs the permission
// because an aurora is not an object. Everything else in this collection is
// something IN the glass -- a point, a heart, a pair, a filament, shells,
// flashes -- or, in nebula's case, weather that fills it. This is the only one
// whose interior is a field with a direction: curtains hanging vertically,
// bending as they stream sideways, which is a shape the rest of the family has
// no vocabulary for.
//
// A CURTAIN IS A VERTICAL SHEET WHOSE POSITION WANDERS WITH HEIGHT AND DEPTH,
// which is one line: the sheet sits at x equal to a sum of two slow waves read
// in y and z, and the density is a gaussian in the distance from it. Two
// incommensurate waves rather than one, because a single wave is a corrugation
// and reads as machined. Three curtains at three offsets with three phases give
// the stacked, overlapping look that makes an aurora read as a curtain rather
// than as a stripe.
//
// AURORAE ARE BRIGHT AT THE BOTTOM AND FADE UPWARD, and getting that one profile
// right is most of what makes this read as an aurora rather than as a vertical
// smear. The lower edge is where the atmosphere is dense enough to glow hard;
// above it the light thins out over several times that height. So the vertical
// term is a sharp rise at the foot and a long exponential decay above it, and it
// is asymmetric on purpose -- a symmetric profile reads as a band of light and
// not as a curtain hanging.
//
// THE STRIATION is the fine vertical structure real curtains have: a gentle
// modulation across the sheet, gated by mh_aa so it retires itself the moment a
// cycle would be under two pixels. It is the thing that makes the large mount
// worth watching and the first thing the small mount gives up.
//
// LEVEL RAISES THE CURTAINS: voice extends their height and brightens them,
// which is the most literal thing an aurora can do with energy and the right one
// -- a louder room gets a taller display. ACTIVITY QUICKENS THE STREAMING, so
// cadence moves the curtains sideways faster and bends them harder as they go.
//
// RESPONDING MAKES THEM LEAN AND RUN ONE WAY. The bend phases align, the drift
// doubles, and the whole display streams in a single direction instead of
// wandering -- an aurora with a wind in it.
//
// THE GESTURE, every eleven seconds or so: a brightening surge travels across
// the curtains from one side to the other. Auroral substorm, in miniature.
//
// SUCCESS: the surge runs the full width on the state's sweep and every curtain
// lifts under it, then settles brighter.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt two curtains crossfade away, the one that remains is twice as
// wide and its bend is halved, and the striation is gone. What survives is a
// single broad band of light leaning through a warm bead -- which is the least
// an aurora can be and still be streaming.

// MARK: - 13. Tempest

// TEMPEST. A contained storm: weather churning, with lightning buried in it.
//
// NEBULA'S SIBLING AND ITS OPPOSITE TEMPERAMENT. Both are weather and both are
// domain-warped mist, and everything else about them differs. Nebula is lit
// evenly from within and its business is depth: near folds silhouetting against
// a deep glow. This one is lit from INSIDE ITS OWN FLASHES, its density runs
// harder so the cloud has real dark in it, and its business is energy: a body
// that is calm when nothing is happening and visibly working when something is.
//
// THE FLICKERS LIVE DEEP AND NEVER REACH THE SURFACE, which is the species'
// one inviolable rule and the difference between a storm in a jar and a
// novelty lamp. Two things enforce it. A depth mask kills any flash outside
// 0.62 of the radius outright, so nothing can ignite near the shell. And the
// flashes are evaluated INSIDE the march, so the cloud in front of them
// attenuates them exactly as it attenuates everything else -- what reaches the
// eye is a glow diffused through weather rather than a light with an edge. A
// flash solved outside the loop, the way comet's head is, would sit on top of
// the cloud and the species would be over.
//
// AND THEY DO NOT STROBE. The envelope is the flourish clock's sin-squared,
// which is flat at both ends, over a gesture lasting most of a second: it
// arrives and it leaves, and there is no frame where it switches. Two lanes at
// 2.9 and 4.3 second slots interleave without ever landing together, so the
// storm has an irregular pulse rather than a beat. At rest the lanes are slow
// enough that minutes pass quietly.
//
// ACTIVITY IS THE STORM, and this is the deepest reading of cadence in the
// collection. It raises the churn, quickens the weather, and shortens both
// flicker slots -- so an assistant that is working has visible turbulence and
// lightning in it, and one that is idle is a calm dark cloud. THINKING adds to
// the same term on top of the signal, because that state is the one this
// species was built to wear. LEVEL LIGHTS THE CLOUD: voice lifts the ambient
// glow without touching the churn, so speaking makes the weather visible rather
// than making it worse.
//
// RESPONDING GIVES THE STORM A HEADING: the whole domain advects one way and the
// flickers stop wandering, so churning becomes streaming.
//
// SUCCESS: the cloud ignites from the inside and a front travels out through it.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the noise scale halves so the folds are features rather than
// grain, the warp comes down with it, and the flickers grow by two thirds and
// come round half as often -- one soft flash inside a dark bead every several
// seconds, which is the species in the fewest events it can have.

// MARK: - 14. Helix

// HELIX. Two strands winding a vertical axis: the double helix.
//
// THE GESTALT TEST IS THE SPEC -- somebody says "DNA" inside three seconds or
// the species has failed -- and the first build failed it by being a cousin of
// flux: broad soft strands on a leaning axis read as crossing horizontal
// streaks. Three things were wrong and all three are structural.
//
// THE AXIS IS VERTICAL AND STAYS VERTICAL. It was leaning up to twenty degrees,
// which is enough to destroy the read: a helix is legible only against a clear
// upright, and once the upright tips the crossings stop looking like crossings
// and start looking like a weave. The yaw is kept -- rotating about the vertical
// turns the pair toward and away from the viewer without disturbing the upright,
// which is exactly the motion this wants -- and the tilt is down to about six
// degrees, enough that it is not a diagram.
//
// THE CROSSING RHYTHM IS COUNTED, not left to fall out. A double helix seen
// side-on crosses twice per turn, so the roster's "turns" is now set to put
// about one and three quarter turns inside the visible height: three or four
// crossings, which is the count the eye reads as a helix rather than as a
// spring. More than that is a coil; fewer is a wave.
//
// THE STRANDS ARE THREADS, and getting there meant giving up the atan2. The
// distance to the strand is measured IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE AT THE SAMPLE'S OWN
// HEIGHT: at height y the strand is one point in that plane, so the distance is
// a subtract. That costs one sincos where the angular form cost an inverse
// tangent, which is what makes twenty steps affordable -- and twenty steps is
// what lets the strand be 0.062 wide instead of 0.11. The approximation
// overstates the cross-section by the secant of the pitch angle, about a fifth
// here, and is absorbed into the width. It is the same trade arc made and it
// buys the same thing: a thread instead of a rope.
//
// AND THEY TAPER LIKE ARC'S. Width and brightness fall together on one profile
// in height, so each strand is thickest and brightest in the middle of its run
// and vanishes to nothing top and bottom -- the pair emerges from the glass and
// returns to it rather than being cut off by the shell.
//
// EVERYTHING ELSE GETS OUT OF THE WAY. The medium runs at a third of what the
// other luminous heroes carry and the rim at three quarters, because this is a
// species whose whole content is two thin lines and anything else in the body
// competes with them for the read.
//
// LEVEL feeds the strands, ACTIVITY quickens the climb, RESPONDING winds it
// tighter and drives it up, the gesture draws it in for a breath, and SUCCESS
// runs a bright band up both strands to the top.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the turns halve to about one -- three crossings inside a
// thirteen-point bead is a texture -- and the strands thicken by 90 per cent.
// What survives is two threads crossing once, which is still unmistakably the
// figure.

// MARK: - 15. Geode

// GEODE. A cut crystal inside the glass, catching light face by face.
//
// A FACET IS A PLANE, AND THE FIRST BUILD'S WASN'T. It partitioned the volume by
// which of six DIRECTIONS a point was most aligned with, which is a defensible
// way to divide a sphere and a hopeless way to draw a crystal: the partition was
// then integrated along the view ray, and integrating a hard-edged structure
// through five samples averages exactly the angularity that was the point. What
// drew was a fuzzy blob with a bright wedge in it -- no planes, no edges, no
// believable angles.
//
// SO THE CRYSTAL IS A REAL CONVEX SOLID, INTERSECTED. Four axes make eight
// planes -- a slab per axis, with different offsets on the two sides so the
// solid is an irregular gem rather than a symmetric octahedron -- and the ray is
// tested against them by the slab method: the entry is the LAST plane the ray
// crosses going in, the exit is the FIRST it crosses coming out, and the solid
// is hit when the entry precedes the exit. That is eight divides, it is exact,
// and it gives what the direction partition could not: real straight edges
// meeting at the angles the plane offsets actually imply.
//
// AND THE ENTRY PLANE IS THE FACE YOU ARE LOOKING AT, which is the whole species.
// Its normal shades it against the key, so as the solid turns, faces come up
// bright one at a time and roll away into near-darkness -- some face-on and
// blazing, some edge-on and almost black, exactly as a cut stone does. Nothing
// animates this; the rotation does all of it.
//
// SOFT-EDGED WITHOUT BEING BLURRED, and the two are not the same thing. The
// silhouette softens for free: the chord through the solid goes to zero at every
// edge of the silhouette, so the crystal fades out where it is thin rather than
// stopping at a line. The interior edges soften from the runner-up: when two
// entry planes are nearly equally last, the ray is arriving at an edge, so the
// shading normal blends between the two faces over a narrow band. Both are soft
// transitions across HARD geometry, which is what "angular structure with soft
// edges" means and what a blur cannot imitate.
//
// LEVEL OPENS THE STONE: voice widens each face's response to the key, so more
// faces are lit at once. ACTIVITY TURNS IT, so the light crosses faces faster.
// RESPONDING settles the tumble into one steady rotation.
//
// THE GESTURE, every ten seconds or so: one face takes far more than its share
// for a breath, the way a real stone throws a flash as it passes an angle.
// SUCCESS lights every face at once, which on a faceted body is unmistakable.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the fourth axis retires, leaving a six-faced solid whose faces
// are half again as large -- eight facets across a thirteen-point bead is a
// texture, six is a gem -- and the edge lines switch off.

// MARK: - 16. Sol

// SOL. A miniature sun: one composed core, and prominences as calligraphy.
//
// THE CORE IS THE MASS AND THE PROMINENCES ARE THE LINE, and the first build had
// neither. Its core was marched, so what drew was whatever shape five samples
// happened to make of a soft ball -- an amoeba -- and its prominences were wide
// angular lobes that merged with the corona into the same mass. Both are now
// solved rather than sampled, and they are solved differently because they are
// different kinds of thing.
//
// THE CORE IS A PERFECT DISC, and it costs one square root. The photosphere is a
// sphere centred at the origin, so the only thing a view ray needs to know is
// its own perpendicular distance to that origin -- and a disc thresholded on
// that distance is exactly, analytically round from every angle, at every frame,
// with no sampling in it anywhere. It is droplet's discipline applied to the one
// hero that most needed it: centred, circular, breathing a couple of per cent on
// the house breath, and nothing else.
//
// THE PROMINENCES ARE THIN ARCS THAT LIFT AND FALL. Each is rooted at two points
// on the core's limb and arches out between them -- swept along the surface by
// an angle and lifted radially by a height that rises and falls on its own long
// cycle. They are integrated the way arc's filament is: sample the CURVE for the
// point nearest the ray, refine it with a parabola, and use the closed form for
// a gaussian tube crossed at an angle. That is what makes them thin. A marched
// prominence has to be wide enough for the march to find it, which is precisely
// how the first build's became lobes.
//
// ONE OR TWO AT A TIME. Three prominences on periods of 13, 17 and 21 seconds,
// each spending most of its cycle flat against the surface, so the sun is never
// symmetric and never crowded. The lift is sin-squared, flat at both ends, so a
// tongue leaves the surface and returns to it without ever appearing.
//
// AND THE CORE OCCLUDES THEM. A prominence whose nearest point lies behind the
// core's front surface, within the disc, is hidden -- which is what puts the far
// tongues behind the star instead of in front of it, and is the cue that makes
// the core read as a solid body rather than as a bright patch.
//
// THE KNEE STILL DOES THE HEAVY WORK. The photosphere runs well above the rail's
// top and the tongues an eighth of it; under a clamp the core would be a flat
// white plate and the prominences would be the only picture. The asymptotic
// compression is what keeps structure in the core while the line work stays
// separable.
//
// LEVEL LIFTS THE TONGUES and brightens the core. ACTIVITY quickens the
// granulation crawling across the photosphere -- read in the volume, never on
// the direction, because direction is undefined at the centre and sampling it
// there grew a starburst out of the core. RESPONDING biases every tongue toward
// one heading. The gesture arches one much higher; SUCCESS lifts all of them.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt one prominence retires, the survivors thicken by two thirds,
// the granulation switches off and the core grows. What survives is a small
// round sun with one tongue standing off it.

// MARK: - 17. Abyss

// ABYSS. Deep-sea dark glass: rare glows passing through, mostly night.
//
// THE PATIENCE PIECE, and it is the only hero in the collection whose default
// state is genuinely almost nothing happening. Still is quiet; this one is dark.
// The distinction matters: still's rim and catchlight are the figure and they
// are there every frame, where here the rim is a thin cold line holding a
// silhouette and the events are the species -- and the events are RARE. At the
// default `rarity` a creature passes roughly every twenty seconds, and between
// them there is a dark bead with an edge. Nothing else in this collection asks
// the viewer to wait, and a set of eighteen presences needs one that does.
//
// RARITY IS THE SLOT LENGTH and it runs the intuitive way: high is rarer. Three
// lanes on long, independently jittered clocks, so the gaps between passes are
// never equal and two creatures overlap only occasionally -- which is exactly
// when the frame is worth catching.
//
// A CREATURE IS A PASSAGE, NOT AN APPEARANCE. It enters on one side of the
// volume and leaves by the other over the whole life of its gesture, on a line
// hashed per pass, so what the eye sees is something crossing rather than
// something switching on in place. It is solved at the ray's closest approach --
// the same closed form comet's head and droplet's heart use -- so it is round
// and stable, and most of its light is in the scatter, because a glow in deep
// water is mostly the water it lights.
//
// LEVEL BRINGS THEM UP. Voice brightens whatever is passing and, more usefully,
// shortens the clocks: speak to it and the abyss becomes populated. That is the
// one reading of `level` that suits a species whose subject is scarcity --
// brightness alone would say nothing about a body that is dark on purpose.
// ACTIVITY QUICKENS THEIR DRIFT, so a busy assistant's creatures cross faster.
//
// RESPONDING TURNS THEM INTO A PROCESSION: the paths align on one heading and
// the clocks shorten hard, so rare passages become a steady stream in one
// direction. It is the largest behavioural change any state makes to any hero
// here, and it should be: this is the species with the most room to change.
//
// SUCCESS: the whole volume lights once, briefly, the way a deep-sea bloom does,
// and falls back to night a little less dark than before.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt one lane crossfades away and the survivors grow by 80 per cent
// and brighten, because a small dim glow inside a small dark bead is invisible
// rather than restrained. The clocks also shorten by a third: at a glance you
// should see the species do its one thing, not wait through its silence.

// MARK: - 18. Chorus

// CHORUS. Many faint lights breathing loosely, falling into alignment.
//
// THE ONE HERO LICENSED A RHYTHM, and the licence is narrow. The family's verbs
// are FLOW and SETTLE, and breathing luminance is banned as a default motif
// precisely because it is the first thing everyone reaches for. The carve-out in
// the house rules is for a species whose concept literally IS a rhythm, and an
// ensemble breathing is that: the pulse is not decoration on the idea, it is the
// idea, and the thing the species is actually about is not the breathing at all
// but the PHASE RELATIONSHIP between the breaths.
//
// SO THE DESIGN IS SYNC, NOT PULSE. At rest the voices are scattered across the
// cycle -- `sync` at zero spreads them over a full period -- and what the eye
// reads is a loose, uncountable shimmer with no beat in it, because nothing ever
// coincides. As sync rises they gather, and at one they breathe as a single
// body. RESPONDING drives sync most of the way to one, so an assistant that is
// answering visibly pulls its ensemble together. That transition from many
// rhythms to one is the whole species, and it is why the rhythm had to be
// allowed: you cannot show alignment without something to align.
//
// KEPT GENTLE, which is the other half of the licence. The depth of the breath
// is capped so no voice ever goes out entirely -- the floor is a third -- and
// the period is long, eight seconds and up. What that produces even at full
// alignment is a slow swell across a field of small lights, not a blink.
//
// SEVEN VOICES ON A FIBONACCI SHELL, so they are evenly spread over the sphere
// without any two ever lining up into a row or a ring. Each drifts a little on
// its own slow path, and each is solved at the ray's closest approach, so seven
// compact lights cost fourteen dot products and are perfectly round.
//
// LEVEL PICKS OUT THE NEAREST. Voice does not simply brighten the ensemble: it
// weights each voice by how near the front of the glass it is, so speaking makes
// the closest lights bloom and leaves the far ones where they were. An ensemble
// where the front row answers is a much better picture of being listened to than
// one where everybody gets louder.
//
// ACTIVITY QUICKENS THE BREATHING a little, and only a little: this is the hero
// where a fast rhythm would be worst.
//
// THE GESTURE, every eleven seconds or so: one voice swells well past the rest
// and subsides, the way a single singer lifts out of a choir.
//
// SUCCESS: every voice reaches full together, which after a hero built entirely
// on their not coinciding is the most legible arrival in the collection.
//
// SIZE: at 18 pt the ensemble drops from seven voices to three and they grow by
// 70 per cent, because seven faint lights in a thirteen-point bead is a texture
// and three is a group. Their breath also deepens, since with fewer voices there
// is less overlap to carry the motion.
