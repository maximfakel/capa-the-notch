// The Orb pack. Eight thinking indicators, and this is the one family in Murmur
// that is allowed to draw a countable thing.
//
//   mo_breathe   the resting orb: the whole lattice inhaling and exhaling, the
//                breath arriving at the front of the sphere before the back.
//   mo_orbit     latitude bands streaming around the sphere at neighbouring
//                speeds, the way a gas planet's do.
//   mo_glimmer   dots catching light one after another in a scattered order: a
//                constellation being counted.
//   mo_vortex    the lattice drawn up toward a pole and twisted as it goes,
//                wound into a crown and released.
//   mo_gather    dispersion converging into one bright ring. The only species
//                here with an arrival, so the only one that reads `epoch`.
//   mo_stir      dots jostled out of their seats and settling back: the sphere
//                thinking with its hands.
//   mo_daybreak  a terminator sweeping the sphere. Dawn crossing a small planet.
//   mo_skein     dots strung along a winding thread that wraps the ball, with a
//                bead of light running its length.
//
// WHY THIS FAMILY EXISTS AT ALL. Everywhere else in Murmur the dot is banned,
// and the ban is not decoration: a discrete circle is the fastest way to make a
// generative field look like a screensaver. The carve-out here is deliberate and
// narrow. The rotating fibonacci dot sphere is THE canonical AI thinking
// indicator -- the thing a person recognises before they have read a word of the
// UI -- and a set of thinking indicators that refuses to speak the genre at all
// is a set with a hole in it. So the genre is spoken, and it is spoken in the
// house's own material rather than in the reference grid's flat white.
//
// WHAT "IN OUR STYLE" HAD TO MEAN, concretely, or this would have been a clone:
//
//   THE DOTS WEAR THE RAIL. Not one pixel in this file is white, at either end
//   of the material dial. A dot's body, its peak, its shaded flank and its
//   far-side ghost are four positions on the SAME single-hue rail the rest of
//   Murmur walks, and the material dial is nothing but a choice of which stretch
//   of that rail the material lives on. That is the value hierarchy the device
//   review asked for, and here it has a second job: it is also the thing that
//   makes a flat scatter of circles read as a SPHERE.
//
//   THE ACCENTS ARE COLOUR, NOT BRIGHTNESS. A fraction of the dots -- chosen by
//   a hash of the LATTICE INDEX, so a dot keeps its accent while it is jostled,
//   swept, wound and re-seated -- refuse to climb past the tone's saturated
//   stop. Where their neighbours go pale they stay gold. In a one-hue palette
//   that is the only honest way to have an accent at all, and it is why the
//   accent set does not flicker: it is a property of the dot, never of the
//   pixel.
//
//   THE GROUND IS INK AND THE SILHOUETTE IS THE FIGURE. The sphere brings itself
//   to nothing at its own limb, well inside the circle clip, so the clip is a
//   guarantee and not the design. Under the dots there is a very faint warm body
//   because a sphere with nothing between its dots is a handful of confetti, and
//   the figure law wants an object.
//
// THE MATERIAL IS A DIAL, NOT A DECISION, and this is the correction that came
// back from the device. c3 on every species is `material`: 0 is pale and
// restrained -- soft cream dots, a quiet terminator, a sparse scatter of gold
// accents, no bloom -- and 1 is the molten amber lantern this pack was first
// built as. The molten end is not a preset sitting beside the pale one; it is
// literally the constants the first cut shipped with, so nothing that was
// approved has moved. What the dial does in between is described in full at
// mo_material, and the short version is that it moves the material UP THE RAIL
// rather than turning a brightness down. The default is 0.3: the reference
// register, with a hint of warmth in it.
//
// THE HARD PART, AND HOW IT IS DONE. A dot sphere in a fragment shader is a
// nearest-point query: for this pixel, which lattice point is under it, and how
// far. Looping over a hundred and fifty points per pixel is the obvious answer
// and it is the wrong one -- at 300 pt that is a hundred and twenty million
// distance tests a frame. So the lookup here is the INVERSE SPHERICAL FIBONACCI
// mapping (Keinert, Innmann, Sanger, Stamminger, SIGGRAPH Asia 2015): the
// spiral's own arithmetic is inverted in closed form to name the lattice cell a
// direction falls in, and the answer is the four corners of that cell. Four
// candidates, constant time, independent of the lattice count. mo_lattice below
// is that, derived rather than transcribed so the reasoning stays on the page.
//
// It is called twice per pixel -- once for the near hit of the view ray and once
// for the far one -- because the back hemisphere showing dimly THROUGH the front
// is most of what makes the ball look round, and there is no cheaper way to know
// what is back there than to ask.
//
// THE TEMPO. Every species turns. A dot sphere that is not rotating is a
// diagram, so the slow spin is the family's heartbeat and each species' own
// mechanic rides on top of it rather than replacing it. About sixteen seconds a
// turn at speed 1, with an fBm wander on the rate so it is never a metronome,
// and one aperiodic gesture per species on the four-to-nine second clock the
// signal pack uses. Motion the eye feels rather than watches.
//
// COPIED HELPERS. Cross-file Metal linkage is not guaranteed, so the kit is
// copied out of FieldLab.metal and FieldPackPour.metal VERBATIM under an mo_
// prefix, the way the house has done it before. Copied, unchanged except for the
// name:
//
//   mo_hash, mo_grad3, mo_noise3, mo_hash1, mo_vnoise1, mo_fbm1,
//   mo_srgb_to_linear, mo_linear_to_srgb, mo_linear_to_oklab,
//   mo_oklab_to_linear, mo_lch, MOPalette, mo_palette, mo_shade,
//   mo_out, mo_knee, mo_settle_law (pv_exhale_law), mo_tier, mo_flourish
//
// Their comments come with them: the reasoning is the part worth carrying. Not
// copied: fl_noised3 / fl_fbmd3, because nothing here lights a surface by its
// slope -- the light on a dot comes from where the dot IS on the ball, which is
// a dot product and free. fl_edge is not copied either; mo_containment is the
// radial equivalent, written rather than adapted. And fl_fbmd3's plain sibling
// fl_fbm3 is not copied because the two species that warp their lattice want a
// single BROAD fold rather than a spectrum -- an octave stack folds the sphere
// at several scales at once, which disperses a lattice into fog instead of into
// a scatter -- so they call mo_noise3 three times for a vector and stop there.
// Copying an fBm nobody calls would only leave dead code behind a prefix.
//
// ONE RENDERER, EIGHT SPECIES, and this pack is the only one built that way. The
// other four families each invent a figure per species, so a shared body would
// have been a straitjacket. Here the SPEC says it outright: "the figure is
// always the sphere of dots". Eight private copies of the same ray cast, the
// same lattice lookup and the same shading law would not have made eight species
// -- it would have made eight chances to drift apart. So the ball is written
// once, in mo_orb, and each species is exactly the two things that are actually
// its own: mo_warp, which says where its dots sit, and mo_level, which says how
// brightly each one burns. Both are switched on a tag that is uniform across the
// whole draw, so the branch costs nothing and every species still gets its own
// physics and its own paragraph.

///   0  PALE. Soft cream dots -- the rail's own top stop, #FFDEB2 at the house

///
///   the tier split   the spine. Moving K from 0.78 to 0.42 lifts the whole

///   the key light    compressed at the pale end, from a range of 0.98 down to

///                    instead of 0.60 to 1.32). A pale dot with a hot centre is
///                    a bead; a pale dot that is one value is a dot.
///   accent share     eight per cent to twenty. See mo_accent.
///   accent warmth    the accent band's top runs to the tone stop exactly at the

///                    end the neighbours are already warm, so the band lifts a
///                    little to keep the accent distinguishable.
///   the far side     dimmed harder at the pale end, because the pale ramp lifts
///                    everything and the back hemisphere has to be pushed back
///                    down or the ball goes transparent.

// THE LIVE SIGNALS, and the one rule that governs every use of them in this file.
//
// `level` is voice energy and `activity` is typing or token-stream cadence, both
// 0...1, both arriving fresh every frame from the host. They are the difference
// between a presence and a decoration, and they are also the easiest way to put
// a stutter in a rotating sphere.
//
// A LIVE SIGNAL MAY NEVER TOUCH A RATE. Every rotation in this pack is an angle
// of the form rate * t. Multiply that rate by a signal that changes between
// frames and the ANGLE jumps by the change times however many seconds the app
// has been running -- at half a minute in, a two per cent wobble in the mic
// level throws the sphere most of a radian, every frame, which reads as a
// vibrating ball and not as responsiveness. It is the same trap mo_drive_turn
// exists to defuse for the responding state, except that a state change happens
// once and can be integrated in closed form, while a live signal changes forever
// and cannot.
//
// So the signals here only ever move MAGNITUDES: a radius, a dot size, a band's
// contrast, a swirl's depth, a ring's tightness, a tremor's floor, a flare's
// width, a bead's length. Every one of them is written so that a signal of zero
// leaves the species exactly as it was designed, which is also what makes them
// safe to leave unwired: a host that never sends a signal gets the orb that was
// approved, to the pixel.

/// WHERE THE DOTS SIT. Four of the eight species move their lattice, and all
/// four do it the same way: by warping the direction the lookup is done in,
/// never by moving the lattice itself. Warping the query is the only affordable
/// option -- there is no list of points to push around -- and it is also the
/// truer one, because it keeps every dot on the sphere and keeps the silhouette
/// exactly where it was. A dot's IDENTITY, and therefore its accent, travels
/// with it, because the index it comes back with is the index of the seat it
/// left.
///
/// The four that do nothing here (breathe, glimmer, daybreak, skein) say what
/// they have to say in the light instead. That is a real division: a species is
/// either moving its material or lighting it, and the ones that try both at once
/// were the ones that read as busy.

// THE ONE IDEA is that the breath has DEPTH. The phase is lagged by each dot's

// about a third of a cycle before it reaches the far one, and what the eye sees
// is a wave passing through a solid rather than a circle changing size. `depth`
// is that lag, and at zero the ball breathes as one piece, which is the duller
// but perfectly honest end of the dial.
//
// WHY A PULSE IS ALLOWED HERE. The house verbs are flow and settle and pulsing
// luminance is not a default motif -- but the exception the rule states is a
// concept that literally IS a rhythm, and this is that concept. Even so the
// brightness is the junior partner: the dots' SIZE carries three quarters of the

// MARK: - 4. Vortex

// VORTEX. The lattice drawn up toward a pole and twisted as it goes.
//
// TWO GEOMETRIES, and neither one alone is a vortex. The DRAW is a power law on
// the latitude that pulls every ring toward the north pole and packs them
// tighter the further they travel; on its own that is a squeeze. The TWIST is a
// rotation about the same pole that grows with latitude, so the rings that have
// been drawn furthest have also been wound furthest; on its own that is a shear.
// Together the lattice spirals into a crown, which is the thing the roster asked
// for and which neither term can say by itself.
//
// WHY IT IS AFFORDABLE. Both maps depend on the latitude alone and are monotone,
// so both have closed-form inverses -- one pow and one rotation -- and the whole
// lattice can be dragged up the ball for the price of a query warp. There is no
// per-dot anything, before or after.
//
// THE CROWN STAYS COUNTABLE, and this is the number that took the longest to
// find. Compression is density: where the rings pile up, the dots would merge
// into a bright cap and the species would stop being a dot sphere at its most
// interesting moment. So the Jacobian of the latitude law -- which says exactly
// how much a ring has been compressed -- does two jobs at once: it brightens the
// crowded rings, and it SHRINKS their dots by the same measure. The crown gets
// denser and brighter and stays a crown of dots.
//
// DRAWN AND RELEASED. A thirty-three second beat winds the whole thing up and
// lets it back down, and at the bottom of the beat the exponent is exactly one
// and the twist is exactly zero: the identity map, the plain rotating lattice.
// The species passes through its own resting state twice a minute, which is what
// stops a strong gesture becoming a permanent pose.

// exhaleTime in real seconds, so a slower field still settles when it says it
// will.
//
// THE TWO HALVES OF THE ARC pull in opposite directions and that is the design.
// The DISPERSION is a smooth vector fold added to the query direction: at birth
// it is large enough to turn the lattice over itself several times, which reads
// as a scatter, and the law drains it. The RING is a power law on the latitude
// that pulls every ring of dots toward the equator, opening as the scatter
// closes. So the ball goes from a scrambled cloud to a packed band, and the two
// motions overlap in the middle where it looks like dots finding each other.
//
// WHY A SMOOTH FOLD AND NOT A PER-DOT SCATTER. There is no per-dot anything
// before the lookup -- that is the whole bargain the inverse mapping strikes --
// so a random offset per dot is simply not available. It turned out to be the
// better picture anyway: a smooth fold disperses the lattice without destroying
// the fact that it IS a lattice, so the convergence reads as the same dots
// coming home rather than as one image dissolving into a different one.
//
// RINGED IS NOT STOPPED. The scatter floors at about a twentieth of its birth
// amplitude and the fold's drift keeps advancing at the law's hold rate forever,
// so a settled ring shivers the way a held note does. A field that stops dead is
// a frozen image.

// the limb and comes back, and the picture is never dark.

// itself at the poles, with the winding number saying how many times it goes
// round on the way. The dots near it are the strung ones and the rest of the
// lattice is the ball it is wound on, dim but present -- because a thread with
// nothing to wrap is a squiggle.
//
// THE WIDTH IS MEASURED PROPERLY, and this is the number that makes it read as a
// thread rather than as a lens artefact. The distance to the curve is the phase
// error DIVIDED BY the phase gradient. Without that division the band would be
// measured in radians of longitude, and a radian of longitude near a pole is
// almost no distance at all, so the thread would balloon out into two enormous
// caps. With it the thread is the same width everywhere, which is what a thread
// is.
//
// THE BEAD is a packet of light running the winding from pole to pole, and it is
// what stops this being a decoration: something is TRAVELLING, so the thread has
// a direction and a length, and the eye follows it round the back of the ball
// and waits for it to come out the other side. `trail` is how long the bead is,
// from a tight spark to a long glowing stretch of thread.
//
// WOUND AND UNWOUND. The winding number itself breathes by about a fifth over
// half a minute, so the spiral tightens and loosens and the thread appears to
