// Copy for agent. The lab's whole point is that a designer tunes a species
// by hand and then hands the result to whoever implements it, with nothing
// lost in the handoff. So the export is written for a coding agent that has
// never seen this package: what the thing is, how to get it, the exact call,
// and every number spelled out in prose underneath in case the snippet has
// to be adapted.
//
// Since a state is a full design, the export has to carry six dial sets, not
// one. It prints the construction for every state that departs from its seed
// and lists them all in prose, so nothing depends on a reader knowing what
// the seeds are. The live signals ride alongside them.
//
// House voice throughout: plain sentences, no em dashes, no adjectives that
// sell. The agent reading this needs facts, not a pitch.
