// The mount. This is the AtmosphereField.swift pattern with one change:
// the rectangle is filled with the ink before the effect runs, because
// colorEffect needs opaque pixels to work on and the shader composites over
// that same ink anyway.
//
// A state change crosses the WHOLE design, character knobs included, over
// MurmurState.transitionDuration. That is what makes it read as one material
// rearranging itself rather than two materials swapped.
//
// The clock is the subtle part. `time` is not wall time; it is the
// integrated phase divided by the current tempo, so that `time * speed`,
// which is what every shader uses for its motion, stays continuous while the
// tempo changes underneath it. See MurmurClock for why that matters. With a
// steady tempo, which is almost always, it reduces to elapsed seconds.
//
// Zero is when the view appears. The arc styles measure
// `tau = max(time - epoch, 0)`, so with time zeroed at birth the epoch
// argument is always 0 and a settle arc runs once, from the top, every time
// the indicator comes on screen. Entering thinking or success rezeroes it,
// which is how those states replay an arrival.
